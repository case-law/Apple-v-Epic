It is a tough question. The Mac App Store matters for distribution of Apple software and 3rd parties that can 't create their own download store. Other than that what should it be? I think hying to make it the same as the iOS store (the best place for all so&ware &om all developers) can'twork, big developed have too many otherchoicesto getaround our fees,rules,and review process.We might do betterto consider the Mac App Storeas something more focused to become interesting (examples mentioned below).
GAMES
We and the major game developers have tried high-end gaming on the Mac, like the one this user is refemng to, but have fiuied to generate any sizable business in that genre.
The top PC game titles have aII had previous versions of hot game fitles on the Mac and in the App Store --Command and Conquer. Call of Duty. Tomb Raider. BioShock. Assassins Creed. Right there are five of the top ten PC games of 2015.
The last was BioShock &om Aspyr Media. This past spring made their latest new title available (Bio Shock Infinite $29.99) on the Mac and in the App Store. It gets very good store reviews but doesn't even chart in the top 200 best paid games on the store.
The Sims is the one top 10 PC gaming title that does pretty well on Mac, and that isn 't new it alwayshas.We could have a section on the Mac App Storejustfor The Sims (and similar titles) and at least that could be built into something focused and pretty interesting.
PRODUCTIVITY
On the native productivity app &out it starts and ends with Microso& and Adobe. Neither is on the store because they don 't have to be. They can be on the Mac and dishibute to users without sharing the revenue with us, following our rules on app engineering and business models, or go through any app review process.
The Business and Productivity sections of the store seem to do well for &ee things developers need to get out (example Microsoft One Drive) and for useful utilities you can 't find elsewhere (One Password being the best example). That seems a good use of the App Store as well. You know to go to microsoft com for OIIIce, but where do you go for that interesting file translator, photo filter, WiFi scanner, etc. While there are a few apps most users have, there is a very long tail of things we can 't work without but are hard to find.

This is an ares where I think the hfsc App Store could really grow and excel. We know all the developers,,we knovv the tools ihey use. We could invest more in being the go-io place for all
your development needs. It isn't s giant market, snd there might not be s Ion ol'revenue in it, but it should be growing, snd wonh investing it tor thc Mac platform.

I cnuld see fncusing nn a strnng developer category (there already is nnel and making it hetter known as the place for sll developers ta go to for everything they need and even things they didn" t knaw they need.

I'm sure there are other good ideas for the Mac App Store to focus on, I just thing mainstream productivity and games is the most diAicuft of all categories.

I think the lack of gaming (along with the lack ot native productivity apps) are the main reason the 14fac App Store is dormant.

Dear Tim Cook,

and own an iPhone 6 and iPod Touch 3G. Coming Irom Windows since I was a baby. I am

nosily pleased with OS X snd almost never want to use my desktop anymore. The only thing

thai's stopping me from confidemly leaving Windows is gaming. I love playing games. I want

to maLe games. Gaming on OS X is diITicuil, It's not OS X that's at fault though. I know tltat.

There just aren't enough games available on Msc ss there are on PC, and sometimes, the ones

that ARE available are poorly optimized snd don't run ss well as their Windows counterparts

Even the Steam client is lager on OS X. Nnvv. I knnw that Metal was released a while hack,

and Vulksn is an the harizon, and I know that none of this isApple's ar OS X"sfault. Here' s

what I want. I want to see more gaming on OS X. I want to be able ta confidently drop

Windows and play all tny games on my lvfac. Why am I emsiling you? This may seem very far-

fetched, but, I want yau and Apple as s company to make PC gaming marketable an OS X.

Push developers to bring great gmnes to OS X that also run great. Even if it just means using
