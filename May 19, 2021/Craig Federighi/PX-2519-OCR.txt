Apple Developer Enterprise Program
The Apple Developer Enterprise Program allows large organizations to develop and deploy proprietary, internal-use apps to their employees. This program is for specific use cases that require private distribution directly to employees using secure internal systems or through a
Mobile Device Management solution.

Eligibility

The Apple Developer Enterprise Program is only for the internal use and distribution of proprietary apps in specific use cases that are not adequately addressed with public apps on the App Store, custom apps through Apple Business Manager or Ad Hoc distribution, or beta testing through TestFlight. Your proprietary app must be developed by you for use on Apple platforms.
In addition, the following eligibility requirements apply. Your organization must:
 Have 100 or more employees.

 Be a legal entity. We do not accept DBAs, fictitious businesses, trade names, or branches.

 Use the program only to create proprietary, in-house apps for internal use, and to distribute these apps privately and securely to employees within the organization.

 Have systems in place to ensure only employees can download your internal-use apps, and to protect membership credentials and assets.

 Participate in and pass Apple's verification interview and continuous evaluation process.

Applying
Application
As the person applying to the Apple Developer Enterprise Program on behalf of your organization, you must have the legal authority to bind your organization to legal agreements. You must be the organization's owner/founder, executive team member, senior project lead, or have legal authority granted to you by a senior employee. To start your application, sign in with your Apple ID with two-factor authentication turned on. If you' re already enrolled in the Apple Developer Program for distributing apps on the App Store, or have an iTunes Connect account for distributing another media type (music, TV, movies, or books), you will need to use a different Apple ID.
Verification
Verification is conducted to authenticate your organization's information, to validate your intended use of the program, and to ensure that the App Store, Apple Business Manager, Ad Hoc distribution, or TestFlight would not adequately meet your needs. Your organization must have a D-U-N-S Number, which is a unique nine-digit number assigned by Dun 8 Bradstreet and widely used as a standard business identifier. You can check to see if your organization already has a D-U-N-S Number and request one if necessary. They are free in most jurisdictions. Your organization must also have a publicly available website with a domain name that's associated with your organization. In addition, we may contact your organization to verify other details and continue to evaluate your use of the program. If you choose to renew your membership, your organization will be verified again. Apple reserves the right to reject your application at its sole discretion.
Agreement andPayment
If your organization is approved for membership in the Apple Developer Enterprise Program, you will receive the enterprise program license agreement for review and acceptance. The Apple Developer Enterprise Program is 299 USD per membership year or in local currency where available.

Getting Started
The Apple Developer Program allows you to distribute public apps on the App Store, beta versions of apps through TestFlight, and custom apps to specific businesses, including your organization, through Apple Business Manager or Ad Hoc distribution. The Apple Developer Enterprise Program is only for specific use cases that are not addressed with these options. Before applying, use the drop down below to find out which program is best for you.
