Hi Thomas,

This is an atypical request and we 've been told to direct you to the support documentation on

something any specific team typically deals with and many of us have been out of office.

So I apologize for the delay but if you 'd like a person to speak with, I 'll need a little bit more time to secure that. My initial ETA was unfortunately not realistic as so many people have been away.

Thanks,

Mike and Mark, with all due response, it seems like Epic's request is NOT getting any attention &om Apple. Is this how you handle customer's request? When can we expect for you to be able to find a sufficient support person for us to have a meaningful conversation on the payment that is currently being processed for Epic?

If you cannot provide sufficient support, please escalate within your organization to be able to get the response.

Will look forward to your response.

Best regards,

I joined as a Head of Business and Strategy for Online Services where eCommerce capability is under my domain for Fortnite. So I just want to get additional understanding as how these countries are set up with Tax, Fx as well as other payment methods besides CC/DC.

We could start with a quick intro call perhaps next week?

Looking forward to hearing &om you.

Hello,

Id like to introduce you to Thomas Ko, who recently joined Epic. He is reviewing Apple's invoices to understand international revenues, fees and foreign exchanges

etc.

For us to decide what are the additional currencies to expand to so that we can get more coverage. And found some questions based on what the invoices saidagent vs commissionaire, FX fees are all born by Epic.

Can we set up a call with David, so Thomas can run through a few questions? Or maybe kick off an email to discuss the questions first?
