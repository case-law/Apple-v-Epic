In all of today's action, it did not go unnoticed that we propagated quickly. It was a highlight mentioning in weekly Fortnite stakeholders meeting today. These wins truly matter to our teams here.
I managed to wrangle a redemption code for a Season X Battle Pass and 2000 V Bucks. I will leave it to you to find it a happy home.

Thank you very much for getting Season X off to a great start!
