Good feedback Mark. We will be more descriptive going forward and outline what the issues are.

Thanks.

Thanks Nat. We' ve had "emergency" patches with "critical" fixes every week for quite some time. I worry that these words are losing their meaning. What do you think? Is there a better way to express the priority of each submission to us? I'm open to suggestions - just want to make sure we can correctly adjust priority on our side.

Hey Everyone.
I uploaded an 11.10.1 IOS build earlier today as we' re trying to do an emergency patch to address severalcfiticalissues. The plan would bo to release this build as soon as possible.
It is expected this build will not require downtime and current plan is not to force players onto this version immediately.
I' ll update here if anything changes.
Thanks, -Nat
