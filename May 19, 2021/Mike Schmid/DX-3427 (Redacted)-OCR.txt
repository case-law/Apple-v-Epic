Hi Mark,
Thank you so much for the update. It does seem like a very challenging position to be in! Let Anders and I know if there' s anything we can do on our end to support you and Mike in your discussions.

Best, Mary Ann

I couldn't agree more. Lest night I hsd a stem conversation with our daily contact and told him this can't continue. I' ve also writlen an email to my management to ask for support as we draw a firmer line with Epic. Yesterday, they threatened to escalate to their CEO for a metsdeta rejection. Thaf s ridiculous.

I will only request expedites on their behalf if a fast turnaround is critical to iOS players' experiences.

Again, sorry for the way my partner (Epic) has been acting. Mike and I are often put in the difficult position of representing the partner's interest while not agreeing with their perspective.

Hi Anders,

It looks like 3 of their last 4 versions (8.10.0, 8.11.0, 8.11.1) were expedited and a total of 5 versions in the last 6 weeks. They' ve had 34 (!) over the last year, so the pace is picking up.

Do you think it is possible to reset expectations WRT review time with their team? It almost fseLS like they' re abusing expedite requests due to asystematic issue on their end in the development/OA/submission process.

Hi Mark, The app was submitted at 11:15 AM today. At 4:30 PM the app was Metadata rejected for some necessary clarlflcations. The developer replied at4: 50 PM and then again at 5:41 PM. As a result, the app was approved at 5:45 PM today. Less than seven hours after the initial submission. It is interesgng to note that the developer has yet to release this very, very urgent update. It is still pending developer release. Best regards Anders

Hi Folks,

The Fortnite team is pinging me relentlessly about their latest metadata rejection (use of the word "mini games"). They' ve changed it in game and are hoping the review can continue.Is there anything else holding
them up?

(So sorry for the ping - I' ve held them off as long as I can without it being escalated to executives.)
