to intervene.

If they want something to go live 5mn EST (2am PSST they should not be releasing a few minutes before. Please remind them release can take up to 24 hrs to show on the store. Is this a critical bug fix release? if this is not a crifical bug fix release I want to let the system run it's course and not set unrealistic expectation of them.

Let me know your thoughts.

Standing by. Please prioritize submission of the iOS build wherever possible. Submitting the iOS build before your other valued platforms will reduce latency and ensure smooth release timings. Please help me help you in this regard. Paul.

It is expected that this build will require downtime and current plan is to force players onto this version immediately.

This is an especially significant update so if there is anything additionally we can provide to assist in the review process let us know.
