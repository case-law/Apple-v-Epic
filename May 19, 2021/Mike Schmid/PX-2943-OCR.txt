Retention Grace Period refers to the time period between the end of a customer's subscription (e.g. due to cancelation or non-payment) and the beginning of a new subscription within the same Subscription Group, provided that such time period is no greater than 60 days, subject to change. For purposes of determining the commissions to which Apple is entitled under this Section 3.4(a), the prices payable by End-Users shall be net of any and all taxes collected, as provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2.

To enroll in the App Store Small Business Program, You must provide Apple with any requested information related to You and Your Associated Developer Accounts. If there is a change in Your relationship to an Associated Developer Account, You must update such information. An "Associated Developer Account" is any Apple Developer Program account (i) You own or control or (ii) which owns or controls Your account. For example, as the individual or legal entity who accepted the terms of the Agreement and this Schedule 2, You have an Associated Developer Account if any of the following apply:
· Yo uhave majority (over 50%) corporate, individual, or partnership interest in the ownership or shares of another Apple Developer Program member account.

Apple will determine eligibility and approve qualified Developers for participation in the App Store Small Business Program within fifteen (15) days of the end of each fiscal calendar month.
If the total proceeds of You and Your Associated Developer Accounts amount to no more than $1,000,000 in a future calendar year, You may re-qualify for approval in the App Store Small Business Program in the following calendar year.
Beginning January 1, 2021, You will not be eligible for the App Store Small Business Program if You participate, either as the Transferor or the Recipient, in the transfer of a Licensed Application. For example, if You transfer a Licensed Application from Your developer account to another developer account using the App Store Connect tool, both you (the Transferor) and the other developer account (the Recipient) will not be eligible to participate in the App Store Small Business Program. Similarly, if another developer transfers a Licensed Application from its developer account to Your developer account using the App Store Connect tool, both you (the Recipient) and the other developer account (the Transferor) will not be eligible to participate in the App Store Small Business Program.

PX-2943.4

You and Your Associated Developer Accounts will be disqualified from the App Store Small Business Program and terminated at Apple's discretion, if You or Your Associated Developer Accounts engage in any suspicious, misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act or omission relating to qualification in the App Store Small Business Program (e.g., providing false or inaccurate information to Apple, creating or using multiple Apple Developer Program accounts to improperly benefit from the App Store Small Business Program).
Apple may withhold payments due to You and Your Associated Developer Accounts for violations of this provision.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2, Apple shall be entitled to the commissions specified in Section 3.4 hereof without reduction for any taxes or other government levies, including any and all taxes or other, similar obligations of You, Apple or any End-User relating to the delivery or use of the Licensed Applications.

No later than forty- five (45) days following the end of each monthly period, Apple will make available to You on the App Store Connect site a sales report in sufficient detail to permit You to identify the Licensed Applications sold in that monthly period and the total amount to be remitted to You by Apple. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Apple shall be entitled to a commission, in accordance with this Section 3.5 on the delivery of any Licensed Application to any End-User, even if Apple is unable to collect the price for that Licensed Application from that End-User. In the event that the purchase price received by Apple from any End-User for any Licensed Application is in a currency other than the remittance currency agreed between Apple and You, the purchase price for that Licensed Application shall be converted to the remittance currency, and the amount to be remitted by Apple to You shall be determined, in accordance with an exchange rate fixed for the Delivery Period, as reflected in the App Store Connect tool as may be updated from time to time, pursuant to section 3.1 of this Schedule 2. Apple may provide a means on App Store Connect to enable You to designate a primary currency for the bank account designated by You for receiving remittances (" Designated Currency" ). Apple may cause Apple's bank to convert all remittances in any remittance currency other than the Designated Currency into the Designated Currency prior to remittance to You.

If Apple reasonably believes that such tax is due, Apple will deduct the full amount of such withholding or similar tax from the gross amount owed to You, and will pay the full amount withheld over to the competent tax authorities. Apple will apply a reduced rate of withholding tax, if any, provided for in any applicable income tax treaty only if You furnish Apple with such documentation required under that income tax treaty or otherwise satisfactory to Apple, sufficient to establish Your entitlement to the benefit of that reduced rate of withholding tax. Upon Your timely request to Apple in writing, using means reasonably designated by Apple, Apple will use commercially practical efforts to report to You the amount of Apple's payment of withholding or similar taxes to the competent tax authorities on Your behalf. You will indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority for any underpayment of any such withholding or similar taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but

Billing Grace Period refers to the period during which Developers agree to provide paid service for free to users who do not recover from a billing error. In the event that Apple refunds any such price to an End-User, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price for that subscription.

You are responsible for authentication access to content acquired outside of the Licensed Application.
3.12 If Your Licensed Application is periodical content-based (e.g. magazines and newspapers), Apple may provide You with the name, email address, and zip code associated with an End-User's account when they purchase an auto-renewing subscription via the In-App Purchase API, provided that such user consents to the provision of data to You, and further provided that You may only use such data to promote Your own products and do so in strict compliance with Your publicly posted Privacy Policy, a copy of which must be readily viewed and is consented to in Your Licensed Application. You may offer a free incentive to extend the subscription if the user agrees to send this information.

During the period when a Subscription Offer Code allows an End-User to access a subscription in Your Licensed Application for free, You hereby waive any right to collect any royalties, proceeds, or remuneration for such access, regardless of whether any remuneration would otherwise be payable under the Agreement, this Schedule 2, and Schedule 1 thereto, if applicable. The parties acknowledge that, as between Apple and You, the parties' respective responsibilities for the payment of any royalties or other similar payments to third parties with respect to End-Users accessing subscriptions in your Licensed Application via the Subscription Offer Codes shall be as set forth in the Agreement and this Schedule 2.
You shall be solely responsible for Your use of the Subscription Offer Codes, including any use by other members of Your App Store Connect team, and for any loss or liability to You or Apple therefrom.

You will receive proceeds for the CMB Price, which shall equal the Bundle Price set by You less the sum of the retail prices paid by the user for previously purchased Licensed Applications. In the event the CMB Price is less than Tier 1 and greater than zero under the price tiers set forth in the App Store Connect tool, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to set the CMB Price for that user at Tier 1. In the event the CMB Price is less than zero, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to provide the remaining Licensed Applications in the Bundle to the End-User without charge.
