Love this idea. We could also double down on the Jump Start and give this group a larger starting Search Ads credit $200 to $500 that is not dependent on their earnings
(standard credit for 1st time is $100). This would really pay off the Jump Start as we' d be giving them the ability to get started quickly and get to the top of the search results. As you point out, we just need to figure out how to identify a 1st time developer.

» Carson worked on a similar concept several years ago for smaller, indie developers
that we shared with Eddy but we chose not to pursue it at that time. And obviously it didn't include any related to Search Ads because that program didn't exist.

» Carson - please work with Todd on this and let's aim to review it at Staff next Wednesday.

») The 50% of revenue that I referred to is half of the 30% rev share. So in their first year it would be at least 15% rev going to Apple for rev share and up to 15% of the rev going to search ad basics instead of rev share. Does that make more sense?

»» T h ere have been some discussions through the years about how to create a great program for indy developers to get started on the App Store.
»» H e re is an idea called "Jump Start=" Small, independent developers get to use up to 50% of their first year revenue (from app purchases, IAP, and Subscription revenue) toward Search Ads Basic up until some reasonable cap. They would have to be real first time developers (I don't know how we vet that) and maybe also small developers with a brand new title for the first year (to give an opportunity to those who have already been on the store). The cool thing is that new, small developers can use their revenue to accelerate the growth of their new app with guaranteed downloads via search.
»» I t would be worth considering something like this. It would take some thinking to make sure it isn't easy for developers to game this offer (like spinning off every title into new small companies to get a benefit). I think it is important for this to be seen as an App Store program for all small developers, not an iAD program to get developers into iAds (though one would hope they love iAds and would see the benefit).
