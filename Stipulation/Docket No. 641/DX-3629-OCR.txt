XERmOXarKkel'VtpIlaEc.e

Guiding Principle
Marketplace will strive to maintain the equal or higher value of digital entertainment versus its physical counterpart

Supporting Market Data
 Core garners have high engagement, low price sensitivity and affinity for a small number of hit tiles
 Steam maintains a premium digital position with marketplace features valued by garners

Implications
 Marketplace will not expedite the "race to zero" that is happening with games on non-console platforms
 Marketplace will work closely with 1" party and 3" party publishers to define and demonstrate the value of digital games

Marketplace will position the Xbox LIVE brand in a premium manner byfocusing firston content, then on merchandising, and lastly, discounting

 Core garners have high engagement, low price sensitivity and affinity for a small number of hit tiles
 Most marketplaces focus on core garners  Steam trains customers into 'lower margin' behavior by
running frequent promotions

Determine quality of games based on customer belief of quality (i.e. this will vary across a new user vs. a casual user vs. a core gamer)  Marketplace will emphasize high quality content when merchandising  Greater needfordata and analyticsto better use content and merchandising as primary levers over discounting or price

 Digital marketplaces attempting to find ways to differentiate
 Zynga made over $500M on Facebook in 2010  Rovio has sold over 12M copies of the paid version of
Angry Birds in the Apple App Store

Implications
Developdynamic bundles based on customer usage/preferences  Personalize presentation of title selections based on customersegment orspecific consumer preferences  Manage relationship with retailers to minimize impact on sales of other Microsoft products via retail channels  Conduct ongoing experimentation with merchandising to ensure that XBLM stays relevant and is able to tailor offerings to its customers as they evolve  Experiment with 1st party and 3rd party content, such as avatars, to include time based exclusives for premium tiers etc.  Create new product cyclesto extend sales lifespan for game titles  Work closer with 1" party to develop evaluate new businessmodels to enhance monetization offranchises

 Higher cost, complexity and risks associated with console game development
 Doubling game development costs across generations from $4M to $11M for lower end games
 'Hit-based'gaming business driven by lower-risk game sequels

 Females tend to play non-core games  Most marketplaces focus on core garners  Game play innovation is engaging a wider more casual
gamer  Core game marketplaceslackofsuccessin m onetizing
casualgamer segment

Implications
 In the short term, focus on core garners (e.g. 80% on core today) but will change over time (e.g. less focus on core gamer)
 Determine a way to distinguish casual vs. coreagrners
(e.g.Kinect usersasa proxy forcasualgarners,presenta different featured titles for Kinect vs. non-Kinect users)  Correct issues in existing markets to ensure that offerings
are localized  Set up processes to ensure application of local
understanding in product offerings  Set up a partner evaluation process to identify
geographicrequirements and subsequent partner selection process

Key Implications to XBLM

 WW video game market will grow at a 10.5% CAGR from $51B in 2009 to $84B in 2014  Online game segment will grow from $11.7B in 2009 to $30.6B in 2014, a CAGR of 21.3%,
driven by growth in APAC  Wireless game segment will grow from $7.3B in 2009 to $13.1B in 2014, a CAGR of 12.3%  PC Games isthe only decliningsegment
 Traditional physical retailers are expanding their digital presence in games  All major competitors have digital offerings  Competitors typically price digital games at a lower price point than physical games  All digital retail websites focus on targeting the core gamer  New competitors are on emerging gaming platforms such as mobile devices, social networks
and cloud services
 Fast improving technology on mobile phones make it a strong alternative to consoles for non-
core garners
 Developer community on emerging platforms is fast growing resulting in an abundance of games on these platforms
 Downward pressure on price is driven by freemium and ad-based games available on mobile and social platforms
 The Wii, Move, and Kinect coupled with social game publishers developing games for consoles, drives more non-core garners to consoles than ever before
 New revenue models are being explored on mobile and social platforms that compete for gaming mind and wallet share

 Online and wireless games present strong growth opportunities where XBLM can leverage areas of Microsoft's broader portfolio
 A key point of differentiation is required to carve a unique value proposition for XBLM users
 Segmentation is becoming more important with the growth of non-core garners on XBLM who are more price sensitive
than core garners
 There is a need for a strong developer value proposition for games on XBLM to counter developer focus on mobile and socialgames, and also maintaindepth and breadth of games that appeal to XBLM's newer customer segments
 Low priced and free online social games and wireless games challenge traditional gaming price models
 Pricingschemes should be evaluated tocombat popular, emerging revenue models being employed on competing gaming platform marketplaces
