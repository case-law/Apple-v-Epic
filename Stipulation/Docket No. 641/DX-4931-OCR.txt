that your Nintendo Account is set to. You will need to use the remaining funds in your Nintendo Account balance before you will be able to change the country.

· If a Nintendo eShop exists for your region, credit cards issued from your region will not work in a different region's eShop. (For example, credit cards issued for the U.S. will only work in the Nintendo eShop for North America.)
