Tim Sweeney is quiet as CEOs go. But the head of Epic Games isn't shy when it comes to expressing his opinions about the state of games, game development, and the need for open technology initiatives to ensure the industry's future growth. Epic Games is launching Fortnite on Android soon, using direct downloads from the Epic Games site rather than the Google Play store.
I talked about to Sweeney in advance of the launch of the Android version of Fortnite, which now spans all major platforms on consoles, mobile, and PC. The game is a living example ofhow you can take an Unreal Engine game and make itrun across any platform where people want to play games. I have loaded the game on an Android device using Epic's Fortnite installer, and it worked.

GamesBeat: This must have been a lot harder to do, because there are so many versions of Android. How did you approach covering all the ground?

GamesBeat: A lot of people, like Brian Fargo, are saying blockchain could be useful in helping improve that efficiency and getting down to lower percentages.
Sweeney:Yeah, itcould.There was an articleabout somebody making a trade of $1oo million worth of Bitcoin, and of course there's a transaction processing fee associated with that, and it was something like seven cents? That's the ultimate extreme of efficiency in digital commerce. It's an exciting trend.
A lot of the reason that services like Mastercard and Visa charge two or three percent is because they have to provide consumer protections, anti-fraud, customer service, and other systems baked in. That costs real money to operate. That has to be a balancing factor. A store is only really reliable if customers feel they can get good service from it. That's a key consideration in all of this.
