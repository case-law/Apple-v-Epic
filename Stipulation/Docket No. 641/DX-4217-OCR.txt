The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) released 2019 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry in May, 2019. Ipsos conducted the annual research for the ESA. The study is the most in-depth and targeted survey of its kind, gathering data from more than 4,000 Americans about their video game playing habits and attitudes. The 2019 Essential Facts also includes data provided by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) and The NPD Group.

FOREWORD
2018 was a record-breaking year for our industry, with total video game sales exceeding $43.4 billion. Over 164 million adults in the United States play video games, and three-quarters of all Americans have at least one gamer in their household. It's now more important than ever to understand who America's video game players really are and what's driving them.
That's why I'm thrilled to share the 2019 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry. For the first time, we at the Entertainment Software Association have taken a comprehensive look at the individual Americans who enjoy video games and their lifestyles in order to better understand their profiles and interests.
The resulting data speaks for itself. Video game players represent a diverse crosssection of the American population spanning every age, gender, and ethnicity. They live healthy lives, are civically engaged, and are socially active. More than three-quarters report that video games provide them with mental stimulation (79%) as well as relaxation and stress relief (78%). The role of video games in the American family is also changing: nearly three-quarters (74%) of parents believe video games can be educational for their children, and more than half (57%) enjoy playing games with their child at least weekly.
The 2019 Essential Factssimply illustrates what we in the industry already know to be true: we are living in the golden age of video games, and video game players are thriving.
-- Stan Pierre-Louis, Chief Executive Officer, Entertainment Software Association
