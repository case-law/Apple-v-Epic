Introduction

Overview · Starting fall 2016, developers will have more capabilities to manage subscriptions, including additional
pricing granularity and flexibility · 200 price tiers (87 existing and 113 new) across all 155 app stores (25 currencies) · | eo-specific market relevant pricing to allow their subscriptions to be priced consistent with other local competitive offerings and inline with their other distribution channels · Price preservation (aka grandfathering) for existing subscribers when prices are increased
· Im p roved messaging and consents for price increases without price preservation
· See Appendix 1 for the summary of subscription features launching

Approach
· The price points for the 200 price tiers were determined based on various factors including competition, local market conditions, current distribution (see Appendix 2) and the strategic nature of the business opportunity
· Local pricing conventions and Apple preferred price points and step changes were taken into consideration in deciding the on-store retail price points for each currency
· Tiers will no longer be globally equalized (see Appendix 3 for USD equivalents) with tools provided to developers to allow for equalized pricing
· In all territories, Apple's commission will be 30% for billings that occur in the first year of customer's paid service
· Af ter one year of paid service, the commission rate will be 15% for all subsequent renewals (including renewals of upgrades or downgrades)
