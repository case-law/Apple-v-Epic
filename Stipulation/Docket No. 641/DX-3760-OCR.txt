Drivers

Key Points

и WW video game market will grow at a 10.5% CAGR from $51B in 2009 to $84B in 2014 и Online game segment will grow from $11.7B in 2009 to $30.6B in 2014, a CAGR of 21.3%,
driven by growth in APAC и Wireless game segment will grow from $7.3B in 2009 to $13.1B in 2014, a CAGR of 12.3% и PC Games isthe only decliningsegment

и Traditional physical retailers are expanding their digital presence in games и All major competitors have digital offerings и Competitors typically price digital games at a lower price point than physical games и All digital retail websites focus on targeting the core gamer и New competitors are on emerging gaming platforms such as mobile devices, social networks
and cloud services
и Fast improving technology on mobile phones make it a strong alternative to consoles for non-
core garners
и Developer community on emerging platforms is fast growing resulting in an abundance of games on these platforms
и Downward pressure on price is driven by freemium and ad-based games available on mobile and social platforms
и The Wii, Move, and Kinect coupled with social game publishers developing games for consoles, drives more non-core garners to consoles than ever before
и New revenue models are being explored on mobile and social platforms that compete for gaming mind and wallet share

Key Implications to XBLM
и Online and wireless games present strong growth opportunities where XBLM can leverage areas of Microsoft's broader portfolio
и A key point of differentiation is required to carve a unique value proposition for XBLM users
и Segmentation is becoming more important with the growth of non-core garners on XBLM who are more price sensitive
than core garners и There is a need for a strong developer value proposition for
games on XBLM to counter developer focus on mobile and socialgames, and also maintaindepth and breadth of games that appeal to XBLM's newer customer segments и Low priced and free online social games and wireless games challenge traditional gaming price models и Pricingschemes should be evaluated tocombat popular, emerging revenue models being employed on competing gaming platform marketplaces

Drivers of Lower Development Costs on Social and Mobile Platforms и Smaller scope of games -- limited gameplay requirements and expectation for games on social and mobile platforms и Reduced graphical complexity -- screen size and type of engagement do not warrant excessive investment in graphics (e.g. 2D games suffice on mobile,
while consoles push for 3D content) и Lower pricing -- developers limit time and capital spent because of lower price point of games

Key Points и Major streaming vendors, publishers and gaming console manufacturers are marketing their products to the mature gamer; they feature a large
selection of "mature" games and website presentation is geared towards an older audience и Premium-priced games are typically played and purchased by the "mature" core gamer и Mobile and social companies target casual garners with games for all ages и EA's casual gaming site, Pogo, has a very different marketing spin than its main EA Store site
и Companies try to maintain a premium experience for their mature core gamer

Implications of marketplace competition to XBLM.
и Competing marketplaces are focused on or shifting focus to digital games, and they are trying to find ways todifferentiate
и The many digital marketplaces provide consumers with more places to buy games, which could chip
away at XBLM's market share
и Most marketplace share the same focus on the core gamer segment
и Core gamer focused marketplaces have yet to figure out how to monetize the growing casual gamer
segment in a meaningful way и The marketplace that figures out how to successfully migrate casual garners to more of a core gamer
type spending and behavior will reap rewards
