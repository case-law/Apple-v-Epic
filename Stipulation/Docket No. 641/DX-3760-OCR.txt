Drivers of Lower Development Costs on Social and Mobile Platforms · Smaller scope of games -- limited gameplay requirements and expectation for games on social and mobile platforms · Reduced graphical complexity -- screen size and type of engagement do not warrant excessive investment in graphics (e.g. 2D games suffice on mobile,
while consoles push for 3D content) · Lower pricing -- developers limit time and capital spent because of lower price point of games

Implications of trends to XBLM.
· Cheaper, more powerful technology on non-console devices provide more gaming options for
consumers, which reduces the use of XBLM as an entry point to gaming
· Developer and publisher focus ensures breadth of games available on new platforms providing
consumers with greater game options outside XBLM
· Growth of the non-core gamer segment on XBLM shifts average gaming preference from AAA type games to other type of games
· Downward pressure on pricing for games on emerging platforms threatens the value of undifferentiatedgames on XBLM as consumers associate certain game types with lower prices

Key Points · Major streaming vendors, publishers and gaming console manufacturers are marketing their products to the mature gamer; they feature a large
selection of "mature" games and website presentation is geared towards an older audience · Premium-priced games are typically played and purchased by the "mature" core gamer · Mobile and social companies target casual garners with games for all ages · EA's casual gaming site, Pogo, has a very different marketing spin than its main EA Store site
· Companies try to maintain a premium experience for their mature core gamer

Implications of marketplace competition to XBLM.
· Competing marketplaces are focused on or shifting focus to digital games, and they are trying to find ways todifferentiate
· The many digital marketplaces provide consumers with more places to buy games, which could chip
away at XBLM's market share
· Most marketplace share the same focus on the core gamer segment
· Core gamer focused marketplaces have yet to figure out how to monetize the growing casual gamer
segment in a meaningful way · The marketplace that figures out how to successfully migrate casual garners to more of a core gamer
type spending and behavior will reap rewards
