11.12 Apps offering subscriptions must do so using IAP, Apple will share the same 70/30 revenue split with developers for these purchases, as set forth in the Developer Program License Agreement
11.13 Apps that link to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the app, such as a 'buys button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book, will be rejected
11.14 Apps can read or play approved content (specifically magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video) that is subscribed tc or purchased outside of the app, as long as there is no button or external link in the app to purchase the approved content.
