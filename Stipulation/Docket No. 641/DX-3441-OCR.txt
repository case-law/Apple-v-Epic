Methodology
Android to iPhone Switcher Study

Who did we survey?
"Switchers:" iPhone owners who replaced an Android smartphone, and "Potential Switchers:" Android smartphone owners who are seriously considering an iPhone for their next smartphone
8%Aftfid they buy?
Switchers purchased their iPhone within the past 9 months.
Potential Switchers were planning their next smartphone purchase in the next 6 months and have owned their current Android smartphone for over 6
W4iah.products
Switchers acquired one of the iPhone models below.
Potential Switchers had to have been most seriously considering an iPhone 5s,iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, or a 'new iPhone model not yet launched.'

iPhone 6 Plus

iPhone 6

iPhone Ss

Where?
US, UK, France, Germany, Japan and China
How did we reach them?
The survey was fielded from August 1 thru September 8, 2015 using sample from consumer internet panels. Compared with the general population, Internet panels over-represent urban and metro areas and affluent consumers with Internet access.
Other notes
Data for which the base of respondents is less than 50 is not reported and noted as "small base." To simplify reporting, chart labels for values under 3% may not be shown. The term "Top-2 box" refers to the total of the top 2 results in a 5-point scale. Totals, sub-totals, and nets may be off by a point or two due to rounding.
Other key screening criteria: Respondents were required to be 14 years old or older. Potential Switchers must have actively researched iPhone in the context of their next smartphone purchase.
Apple worked with db5 to conduct this study.

Maximum difference (Max-Diff) technique

· We used a statistical technique called "Max-Diff" to quantify the drivers of switching from an
Android smartphone to iPhone. Max-Diff is used when a higher degree of differentiation is desired when measuring the importance of attributes, and when understanding the relative difference across attributes is helpful.

· In this study, respondents answered questions that forced trade-offs between statements
(representing potential drivers of switching). Answers to these questions were used to calculate an Importance Index for each attribute. Importance Index scores are indexed to 100 = average (e.g. Importance Index of 200 is twice as important as 100).

· Switchers answered the question below 15 times but were shown a list of 4 attributes (out

of 29) that varied according to a mathematical design. Potential switchers followed the same

Smartphone brand associations

· A brand association question was asked to understand how iPhone smartphones compare to key competitive smartphones on the same dimensions tested in the Max-Diff exercises

-- Respondents could select up to 10 dimensions per smartphone brand, to understand key brand associations

-- The same dimension could be associated with multiple smartphone brands

-- Switchers were shown three brands: iPhone, the brand they switched from, and the top
brand from the priority list below that was their 2nd choice when switching to iPhone (or the top brand, if none considered)

-- Potential Switchers were shown three brands: iPhone, the Android brand they currently

own, and the top brand from the priority list they are seriously considering for the next
