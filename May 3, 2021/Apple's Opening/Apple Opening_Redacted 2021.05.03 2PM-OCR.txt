If this is coming, please consider the possibility of timing the
progmm to support Fortnite Season 14 launch on 8/27. This launch will follow the confidential Fortnite Mega Drop 20/o price drop that' s coming in mid August, and will be our biggest and best Fortnite season thanks to a huge collaboration with Disney/LVQuvel.

Epic has certain plans for August that will provide an extraordinary
opportunity to highlight the value proposition of consoles and FCs, in contrast to mobile platforms, and to onboard new console users. While I can't share details with any third party at this point, I give you Epic's assurance that our efforts will be positive and suppornve of
Microsoft, Xbox and Windows.

I realize this is incomplete information and you have a big ship

TIM SWEENEY
Epic CEO
DX-3768 Bt 26:31

"We have a lot of platforms coming together, there are the tablet platforms, there are the smartphone platforms, then computers, you know PC and Macintosh,and then there are consoles, Xbox 360, Playstation 360, Wii, and some new handheld dedicated gaming devices, and god knows what else. This is too many platforms.... Over time, these platforms will be winnowed down into a much smaller set of competing platforms -- there might be 1 or 2, maybe 3 winners worldwide across everything -- computers, game platforms, smartphones, so we should expect a lot of consolidation here, and winners and losers, according to who picks the right directions and executes successfully on them."

FRANCINE LAFONTAINE, PhD

Epic's Estimates of the App Store's Margins Are Misleading

L
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE, Pho
Apple Expert

"Mr. Barnes' estimate of the App Store's operating margin is unreliable because it looks in isolation at one segment of the iOS ecosystem in a way that artificially boosts the apparent operating margin of that segment. When one looks at Apple's device and services ecosystem as a whole, the operating margin falls to an unremarkable level."

Epic's Lead Economist: Apple Created Value

DAVID EVANS
Epic Expert Witness

"Apple has obviously made enormous profits and seen the market value of the firm increase because of the success of the iPhone and its application store. iPhone users have done very well also as a result of the tens of thousands of applications they can choose from, some of which enable them to do things that were not possible before. New markets have opened for entrepreneurs that use the iPhone, and some of them are earning significant profits or obtaining fame. By bringing developers and users together the iPhone has served as a catalyst which has created value -- and profit -- out of thin air."

We thought about the fact that the iPhone is a phone that you' re carrying around, you need it to work for you as a phone, and we cared deeply about the security of that device so it would be more protected and more reliable than PCs were at the time.

There is No Tie: IAP is Neither a Product Nor Required
A tie exists only if the defendant actually requires the plaintiff to "take the defendant's product B in order to get its A." Philip E. Areeda 8 Herbert Hovenkamp,Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application 1I 1752c (4th ed. 2020). A tie requires a "condition linked to a sale."Aerotec Int'I, Inc v..Honeywell Int'I, Inc ,8.36 F.3d 1171, 1178 (9th Cir. 2016) ("A tie only exists where the 'defendant improperly imposes conditions that explicitly or practically require buyers to take the second product if they want the first one.'").

Q: And do you consider the console manufacturers to be monopolists within their product?
A: Without reference to all or any legal opinion or conclusion and with a number of exceptions, the console-makers generally do exercise a monopoly on distribution of purely digital games with respect to their platforms, and there are various exceptions.
