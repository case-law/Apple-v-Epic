Fortnite Club with Apple TV+ and Apple Music Bundle:
· Monthly subscription includes Fortnite Club(O'I I.99) with Apple TV+ (84.99) end Apple Music (89.99) for 920.00.
e Co-promote with Apple content both in-game and at the subscription level. ® Offer bundle ideally includes the following key features:
o A vailable g lobally. o R epresents a cost savings of at least 94.99. o A llows for single point of purchase to receive both subscriptions. o E xisting subscribers can easily opt-into the promotion -- no"poor choice". o I n itial limited time offer term, with ability to extend. e Goal: 300K Fortniie Club monthly subscribers -- Increased conversion with Apple support

Proposed terms would focus on maximizing upside for both Epic and Apple.
Based on attribution for where a player subscribes:
® If the players signs up via Fortnite or other Epic channels:
0 Sl 'l.gg monthly gross to Epic, remainder gross to Apple(minos platform fees for both)
o If the player signs up via Apple TV+ or Apple Music: o 9 14.98 monthly gross to Apple, remainder gross to Epic
This way, each partner gets their full baseline revenue from internal signups, plus incremental from other partner's signups. Mitigates risk of downside from people who would otherwise pay for both.
