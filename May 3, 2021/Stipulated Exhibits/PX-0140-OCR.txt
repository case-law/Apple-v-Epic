We review, we do not test. That's been a guiding principle in App Review since we conceived of it. There are iOS apps that are very deep, and we don't get toall of the parle of them. That's OK, and should be the norm. We review what we can quickly and competently get to, we will never have all the expertise or time to go into everything.

There will be times when launch/quit, and poke around at things as best we can, is the appropriate level of review. We can never, and will never, be able to gnd ag the crashes hidden in a complex (or even simple) app. From a functionality standpoint, developers agree (in the PLA and in the guidelines) that they are providing our app store customers with quality apps that do not crash. We review to have some comfort in that assurance, never 100% assurance.

If we find a hotspot of app types that we think needs particular expertise then we' ll develop that, but not for only a few.

And in the case of an app like this we' ll take it one-off, not make e policy. --ck
