Is there anything we can do so Apple could get behind us in a major way? I think there is and that's part of the agenda for Febnsuy 12th when Kim, Tim and I are visiting them in Cupertino. We' re planning to show them the mobile version of FNBR. They' re VERY intemsted in that We' ve also talked about the Mac utuaaon and they' re vmy interested in figuring out how to get Mac users playing the game. So, I'm ON IT!
