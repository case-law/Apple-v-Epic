Tcanl,
Per our conversation at staIT, our goal is to have a 1 day SLA by the end of June. Everything we do should be with this in mind. It may sound crazy, and I know it's going to be difficult to make it to 1 day, but this is what we should be looking at every single day.
I'm not sure if you' ve heard, but it appears that Google Play is going to start reviewing apps. The App Store is better for so inany reasons, but Google is clearly seeing the fact that people trust our store more. And when you trust a store, you' re more likely to spend money there. If Google really starts reviewing apps, there's a likelihood that people will start trusting that store, and who knows what's next. And what's more is that they' ll do it faster thatt we do. Not because they' re going to hire more people, but because they' re finding an automated way of doing what we' re doing. It won't be as good, but it will get better over time.
This is the reason we need to get to one day review. I know that we can do it, and I know that you are exactly the team to inake it happen. With Justin on board and motivating the team, Anders leading Beta aud DA, Naomi getting our new folks up to speed quickly and up-training our more experienced folks, Marts ensuring that we are increasing the quality of our process, Stoney keeping our notables happy and our store policies consistent, Zenus keeping our China store in good shape, and with Evayn's in&astructure team building the tools and network to help us work more smart and fast, I can't see how we can fail.
Moving forward, this is going to be one of the things I discuss in each and every 1:1 and staff
