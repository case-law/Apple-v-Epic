I can't do your Monday slot. Tuesday is no better. Wednesday is good at 1. But you don't need me to proceed.

Regarding your rogue app scenario: this is phishing. For it to work, the phisher would have to have compromised the APNS send key of the spoofed service. That seems unlikely.

Regarding review processes: please don't ever believe that they accomplish anything that would deter a sophisticated attacker. I consider them a wetware rate limigng service and nothing more. Yes, they sometimes catch things, but you should regard them as liNe more than the equivalent of the TSA at the airport. ThNir KPI is "how many apps can we get through the pipe" and not what exotic exploits can we detect?

It will genuinely log you into e-trade but will just siphon the credentials while doing so. That should be pretty straightforward to do. If done properly a user can be kicked into downloading the app and giving it the login info.
