Here are the proofed and slightly cleaned up versions of both quotes, btw Metal was released in June 2014.

We' ve been making use of Metal on iOS to great effect since its release in 2014. A fast, agile, feature-
rich API like Metal is exactly what we need to bring a game designed for modern consoles and desktops to the battery-powered iPhone and iPad. As a developer, it blows away OpenGL in every way. We were able to get Fortnite ship-ready on iOS in a handful of months as we weren't hindered by graphics!

Metal gave us the injectionof perforfnance required for shipping the full Fortnite: Battle Royale experience on
iOS quickly, with no compromises. Porting a garne built for high-end gaming consoles to iOS was a greatly superior experience with Metal than OpenGL,

A quote from scratch, in case it helps: We' ve been making use of Metal on iOS since its release in 2014 (?) to great effect. A fast, agile, feature-rich API like Metal is exactly what we need bring a game designed for modern consoles and desktops to the battery-powered iPhone and ipad. As a developer, it blows away OpenGL in every way. We were able to get Foftnite ship-ready on iOS in a handful of months as we aren't hindered by graphics!
(I had wanted to put in a dig at Android, but felt implied dig was better, hehe)

Whilst factually correct, It's a bit dry and not as hip as one would have expected from the coolest game developer on the planet. Pump it up. Dana and JJ are excellent wordsmiths.

Jeremy Sandmel® Apple is looking for some quotes from Epic on

Perfonnancegain over OpenGL is the SIdifferentiator that allowed us to get PNBR running on iog faster and at higher quality than Android. Here is a starting point:

The performance and features of Metal allowed tts to bring thefull Fortmte: Battle Royale
experience toiOS quickly andat higher qttalitythanis possible with Open GL.
