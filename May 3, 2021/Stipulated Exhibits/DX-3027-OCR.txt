from day one. Q. A n d what year was that? A. I t h i n k it would - it's hard to capture
exactly when you consider the iPhone piece of it,, 'cause we actually started by developing for a tablet
and then we shifted to developing a phone and put the
tablet on hold and then came back and developed the iPad post i P h ane.
I think it was around 2003, 2004, when that w ork began .
Q. W h e n you say "that work began,"' yau're
referring to the early work an a tablet? A . Cor r ec t . Q. A n d when did that work morph into a work--

Q. S o l et's start with the .subject. What is 'Coc'oa Touch?

A. Co c oa, Touch is a name we used ofr'' the frame

works, notably normally the high level frame works for Cocoa cn the iphones, the native frame works.

Now, it's used. in multiple ways,,sometimes, it's used to mean all the frame works, sometimes it' s

used Qust to mean the us«sr 1nt&rf ace le'v'el.

Q. Oka y . An d w h e n y o u w r o t e h e r e : Coco 'a. Touch apps as the subject of your e-mail, that pertains to

native apps, third party apps on the iPhone, correct? A. Ri g h t . I ' m dist.inguishing here between web

apps which we had and continue. to have and this is talking about natively compiled iPhone apps for third

parties using the Cocoa Touch frame works. Q. An d -- y ou ' r e w r i t i ng (a s r e a d ) :

03

Q. A n d you say, for example, the risks of
viruses. T h at's one you identify, correct? A . Co r r e c t . Q. Ano ther one is: Harder to switch
p rocessor s .

04

Why is it harder to switch processors?

05

A. Ye a h , this is a really big deal. W h e n you

06 have a native app, it is compiled into the 07 i nstruction set of a specific processor. F o r

08 instance, if you' re on a Windows machine now-a-days, 09 it's probably compiled into an Intel instruction set.

10

And what w e h a d f o u n d w he n I -- you k n ow,

11 I' ve worked at NeXT and we had actually switched

12 processors and then at Apple we had switched

13 processors again, if you have natively compiled apps

14 out there, that native binary will not just run on

15 your new processor. Y o u have multiple options for

16 t hi s .

17

And so we talked earlier about this when we

18 brought up macOS 10 that we had, you know, like

19 Classic, but that's this, this blue box Classic 20 emulation mode that tries to take those processor

21 instructions and convert them into one that can run 22 o n th e n e w p r o c e s s o r .

23 24
25 0 0102 : 0 1
02 03
04

So in this case when I'm talking about was a risk, well, if Apple is building only natively compile applications and third parties are building web applications, a huge advantage to those third parties of those web apps is no matter what Apple does with the processor, those keep running, because they' re interpreted.

05

So each time you get a new, if Apple

06 s witc he s i P h o n e -- this is true today. I f A p p l e

07 switches to a new processor those web apps have this

08 big advantage that they just keep running going

09 forward, because interpreted on the -- o n t h e

10 p rocessor .

11

And if Apple is running all - - all native

12 apps come from Apple, then to introduce a new phone

13 with a new processor, all you need to do is Apple 14 will recompile every one of those apps, the source 15 code to those apps, to the new processor and then 16 r elease i t .

17

The liability here is if you now have third

18 party natively compiled apps and you want to bring 19 out a new processor which you think will be faster,

20 more security, whatever, and there will be advantages 21 this new processor might have, and there are third

22 party native apps in the marketplace that customers

23 are relying upon, you have to find some solution for

24 t hose c u s t o mer s .

25

The solution could be convince the

s,to take that source code and recompile it

processor. W h ich might work. j3ut if
03 $ th at , j , e t ' say that company is out of business or no -E4 l. l onger' i s taffing that app any more, doesn't want to
,05 ~ ' t j . n t he amount of money and time and effort it

0 6 w o u l d t ake to recompile that, you get stuck.

07 /

S t hen y o u - - l oo k , d o you simulate it also

081 or -d.c you ave customers now who are left not being

09 able t~o uy a new iPhone because doing so would then

10 disa e f u nctionality in the form third party apps

hey

me to rely upon for their business.

1

essentially you get breakage with some of

1

e z p ar ty a p p s potentially if you switch

14 processors?
