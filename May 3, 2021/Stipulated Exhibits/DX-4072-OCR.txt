Subject: [Meeting Block] Liberty block

Hello team,
Thanks for joining ow Run of Show review earlier.
REMINDER: DO NOT DISCUSS gFREEFORTNITE INTERNALLY AFTER WE'VE INITIATED THE MEGA DROP BUT BEFORE irFREEFORTNITE HAS BEGUN. 4FREEFORTNITE ISCONFIDENTIAL (EVEN INTERNALLY) UNTIL ANY ASSOCIATED CONTENT (either social posts or the video) IS LIVE.
We' ve added you all to this meeting block tomorrow that includes the Zoom dial in for our War Room. Additionally, we' ve added you all to our new private dproject-liberty-war-room Slack channel. Ping me if you have ANY issues accessing these channels or need team mates (that have been read in) added. All of these are linked to at the top of the RoS document here: h s //docs oo le cpm/s readsheets/d/luB2u3Du2MMsDEIUV JWSh D-T6IR IlrsxLmHYe5OC /editsus=shaiin
We' ve modified the Run of Show reviewed earlier to have individual sheets for each phase and scenario. The Mega Drop phase isself explanatory, however the additional phaseslisted are modular and sequential (example:executesheet Phase I, then sheet Phase 2a, then sheet Phase 2al based on partner actions). Please review the RoS and make any necessary edits or contact me if you need help making any changes.
Additionally, we' ve linked the Press QdtA doc and all Platform QikA docs (covering responses to partner outreach) at the top of the RoS for reference. I' ve also created a tracking doc where you can include any outreach from partners.
