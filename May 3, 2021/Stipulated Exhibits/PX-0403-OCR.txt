Steve, Scott,
Just a thought:
One of our greatest advantages over Android is our online stores (iTunes Store, App Store, and soon the Book Store). I think that it would be smart to build these three stores as far into the iPhone OS experience as possible to push our advantage. Perhaps in a future version of the iPhone OS these stores wouldn't look and work just like all other apps (icons that you launch) but they were permanent screens that you flick to in the Ul? They would always be there, running and at a difierent level than regular apps.
