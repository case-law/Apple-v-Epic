Pedraum, when can we talk about this? App Review is bringing a plasric butter knife to a gun gght. Investment will have tobe made in making that process more robust or they will keep getting mlled. There are things that can be done, but it is not a small project and isn't something we can solve in the store alone IMNSHO.

If the epps request 5 star and it is witnessed during review, we reject the app

So, if found, we rejecL

Does that answer your question?

Hi Phillip,
Can you determine whether this behaviorwas evident during App Review for the apps in Kristen's spreadsheet? If so, do you agree that they should have been rejected?
It would also be interesting to know if the app did not behave this way during review and was later modified (in response to a setting on some remote system, for example) to take on this aggressive posture.
Thanks, Eric

FYI, Kristen put this together as a list of examples of how developers in China are requesting 5-star ratings:

OK cool. I'm trying to reconcile yesterday's conversation ("charts look pretty clean" ) with Ben Liaw's depiction (" the sky is fallingl").
