1. This is Spam and not a template developer, should never have been fiagged as template

2. I'm dumbfounded with how this could be missed.

3.1 think we will see copy cats and should include school shooting and terrorist related terms in our objectionable content validations.

Hi Trystan,
Quick update while I wait for Steve Rea and Armin to provide an update.
The app was originally assigned to Armin by the TDP with instructions to reject any apps with egregious, malicious, misleading or objectionable content. So far afi evidence points to Annin was going too fast and missedafi the signals to reject these apps for 1.1, or at the least escalate. According to DJ it took a totalof 32 seconds to approve both apps. In addition, the deadliest mass shooting in US history happened two weeks before these apps were approved on 10/18/17. So I assume there was a heightened awareness for these types of apps at the fime of review. We' ve definitely have seen our share of people approving engine apps with issues, but this incident is unique.
Also, it doesn't appear any of the metadata was changed after approval for both apps:
Love shooting games? yl/ebring you the newest high school tenorisl attack where criminals have bombanfed the compound and am making students hostages in this marvelous combination of counter tenorist games and school rescue games. Police is afmady busy taking cern ofrising crime ratein the city so they have given the duty of erasing a/I gangsters of high school attack to super incredible rescue hero s... School shooter simulator is heavily tilled with exceptional combat and tenorist shoobng.
OJusfin, it appears Armin is assisting in template app review. I'd recommend we pull him from TDP duties until we complete our investigafion. On a side note, Armin did have several invalid approval errors we discovered during our TDP audit we completed back in March. This information was shared with Stoney and Rearm.
Detailed report and recommendations to follow once Steve and Armin provide an update and I ask somefofiow-up questions.
Thanks,
Dan

Good evening. My name is~

. i am a t o y e ar old app developer. i currently live in

Miaimar Florida and just had to deal with the terrible school shooting in Parkland. MSD (Marjory

Stoneman Doughlas) was one of the worst school shootings. I recently wrote an app and it wouldn' t

get approved because it had a sign up/ sign in screen. I was stunned to see that a school shooting

app got approved to the iOS App Store. After hearing about it on social media I was in disbelief.

Seeing reviews like, "This is the best school shooting game by far! kkillkidz". I am extremely

appalled that Apple would approve such an app. Here is the link to the app in which I am referring

to: "High School Rescue Hero Squad by Mahmood Ahmed" htt s://itunes.a l e.com/us/a / hi h -

school-rescue-hero-s uad/id1293163219? m=t 8

Thanks for your time.
