No, we donot do this aspartofoureveryday process,butwe do so on a serverwhen we can.

If this were done as part of the iTC back end, it would solve the problem.

Does your team scan apps with .exe's as they come through?

Thanks,

Hi Peter,

Ape Review currently does take apps that we detect as having .exe's and .dll's (excluding those made with Unity or Monotouch) and scan with Norton iAntiVirus and ClamXAV. Its similar to
what we would implement. I set up some time so I can better understand your requested timing, and I can give you more information about how our planning/scheduling process works.

Thanks, Cindy

Thanks for getting back to me. We have been talking to Phillip Shoemaker regarding the App
review process.There are a number of changes that need to be made tobetter secure that space going forward. However, &om what I understand, you all are the first time that the App is brought into Apple. Scanning it at that point makes the most sense. We need to get this prioritized and implemented sooner rather than later. I would anticipate that this is be completed by the end of March or April at the latest. Should we set up a meeting with Tracy to prioritize this?

Hi Peter,
I'm checking with App Review to see what they do for detecting Malware as part of review (should have more info next week, the main person for this is OOO this week). We also surface .exe and .dll files that we find in the app.
Re: getting the radar scheduled, we' ll revisit again when we do our next round of planning in a month. I agree this is important and something we do want to do -- we' ve got other project work going on right now for summer/fall commitments, but feel &ee to check in with me again on this.

ThailkS,

We need to put in better controls around Apps to ensure that we are not bringing Malware into

Apple. This sounds like a decent first step and not sure why we wouldn't be doing this.

What would it take to get this in place?

There is a radar for this, but we don't currently have a timeline for when this will be done (hasn't really been an issue for the app store).

The biggest question we wanted to ask is whether you all do anything to detect malware when we bring new apps in &om iTunes Connect to DJ. I heard that there is a Radar open for you all to implement some type of virus scanning solution. Do you know when that will be in place?

Thanks,

Peter
