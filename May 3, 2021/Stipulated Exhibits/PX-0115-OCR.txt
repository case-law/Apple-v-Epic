As a side note, anotlter devdoper IOigital f1tocolate) reachedout to me this altemoon revarding the topic of real money gambling I get the sense that Big Fish is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to developers acdvely researching opportunities in this arena

Finally, Big Fish also mentioned that they are seeking closure on their proposed subscription
model (as I am sure you remember. the app that originally released last November) lt is safe to ol'6cially tell Bitt, Fish this model is a "no go"" If so. Paul and I can deliver the message

vfotc,

These guys appear to be preny standup guys, but honesUy with the number of "leaks" thev keep having. I'm questiorung tltem as ivell The bottom line is that this app integrates the Betable service. which is banking on their ability to bundle vinual currency gambling and real currency gambling all «ithin one app I do not think Uus is a wise thing to do, and has e told them this repeatedly
