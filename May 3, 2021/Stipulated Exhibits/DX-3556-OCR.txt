Slightly unrelated but related, I found the hardware accelerated HEVC apis that iOS devices support. This

means the AR streaming thing I did can be hardware encoded/decoded on iDevices to/from Mac/PC. Once

Tiger/Siren wrap up, I' ll get that working and then work with the engine area owners to get it into a

We had a call last week with Allan Schaffer (ARKIt devrel) and Rob Partington (Media dk Entertainment
devrel) from Apple developer relations re: face tracking with ARKit on the iPhoneX.

We outlined to Apple that we want to do an animated CG character driven by an iPhoneX, probably for GDC. They' re very supportive of the idea, especially if it's also displayed on an iMac Pro.

We went over some of the points covered in this video: htt s://develo er.a l e.com/videos/ la /fall2017/601/

And also reviewed portions of these docs, which include a sample project that we' ll check out:
htt s//develo era l e cpm/documentation/arkit/creatin face based ar ex eriences

It's pretty much as advertised in their docs.

Vlad was involved in defining some of the 50-ish facial blend shapes that are available within the API, through
previous work with the FaceShift. So he felt coinfortable that the tech could drive a character using a 3Lat rig, although not at the same fidelity as a more detailed Cubic-style capture.

JJfollowed up and asked foriPhoneX hardware,butasofyetthey haven'tlocated any forus.

Next steps are for us to discuss internally and work out when we could start on integration, whether this should
be via Live Link, and better scope out the project.
