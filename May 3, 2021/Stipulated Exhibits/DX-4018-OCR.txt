Proposed Messaging

· I

· Sentiment will be largely positive.
· P layers and press will highlight 20%savings.
· Sentiment will be negative in certain regions where Epic Direct Payment is unavailable.

· L ean intoplayer savings as the primary benefit and secondarily payment choice.
· Ne ed to avoid exposing ourselves thoypocrisy comments with regard to our position on Epic Games Store exclusives.
· Mu st be clear that console savings araeutomaacally appliedto all players.

· Sen timent will bepositive to neutralas long as players can continue to play on their devices.
· Pre ss will beginspeculatingaround the potential legal battle that looms.

· Em phasize that Epic Direct Payment offers playergsreater savings and choice in how Fortnite content is purchased.
· As we enter a public legal battle, state that we believe Apple/Google do not have thleegal right to deny players these savings.

· F ree players(55% oniOS)will react negativelyto being blocked from the game (no benefit).
· P aid players(45% oniOS)may understand the benefit to thebattle (20% savings), but will also be blocked from playing something they love, creating mixed sentiment.

· Em phasize that savings from the new payment system would have gondeirect to the playerbut Google and Apple have blocked this.
· I f we are entering a protracted batae,we will enter into a Paragon situation:need to offer refunds for all Apple/Google users as they can no longer play the game.

Press and Player Narratives if the Game is Blocked
n this scenario, players on Apple/Google are blocked from the app. Examples ofpro-Epicmessaging will be:
· Ep ic Fights for the Players and DevelopersE:pic's battle against store monopolies means greater savings for players via Epic Direct Payment and greater rewards for developers with the Epic Games Store.
· Th e App Store, Google Play and Steam are Anti-Consumer MonopoliesE:pic has proven that a better model exists that removes the middle man and creates a more fair ecosystem for players and developers.
· Sa ving Money is GoodE:pic's actions have a clear player benefit. Google and Apple's stance does not.
Examples ofanti-Epicmessaging will be:
· Ep ic Thinks they are SpecialP:layers and gaming press will point out that Epic thinks the rules should not apply to us. Does E ic reall think the 're s ecial?
· Ep ic is GreedyS:ome players will think that Epic only seeks to profit off of Epic Direct Payment. Why else would we be implementinga new payment system? Wh does E icneed more mone ~
· Pl ayers are Pawns in Epic's BattlesA:ny new negative consequences for players (e.g. no longer able to play, or additional friction in their experience) will be seen as Epic's fault for pushing this cause and they were given no choice in the matter.
· Ap ple/Google Own the Platform":We welcome any developer that recognizes the value of Google Play and expect them to participate underthe same termsas otherdevelopers."(Google's December 2019 response to press)

Speaker Notes for Slide 6
Projections assume gross GP revenue has a 3x relative increase from current levels Purchase Frequency- (i.e., elasticity). How does purchase frequency change in response to a 20% discount? 100% elasticity (-24% purchase frequency increase) needed to fully counteract price reduction. We currently observe fairly low price-elasticity iOS / GP transfer- this refers to the among of iOS and Google Play gross revenue that would transfer onto other platforms, if iOS and GP were shut down. This is based on analysis that -44% of iOS and GP revenue in April came from cross-players, and that a majority of this would move to other platforms.

We Do Not Have Full Price Elasticity in Fortnite
Today

To get a sense of price-elasticity in the current FN economy, we can examine purchase-likelihood among players with varying V-Buck balances compared to the cost of a given outfit in the Shop.
What happens when the difference between players' VB balance and an outfit's price moves to within 1000 VB? (i.e., the out-of-pocket cost lowers from $24.99 to $9 99)
Conversion increases 30-35%, on a 60% reduction in out-of-pocket costs.
(i.e., conversion does not shift up to the same magnitude that cost goes down).
We expect, at best, a similar effect (i.e., only partial elasticity) on the proposed 1820yo price reduction of VB SKUs.

Revenue Implications of Price-changes

While we lack a perfect proxy for assessing price-elasbcily in response to a permanent price-change, wallet-sensibvity analysis suggests that purchase-frequency would not increase at a magnitude that ofhets discounts.

Assuming current trends for iOS and GP continue, a purchase-frequency increase of 5-1 0/o would produce 2020 revenue losses of: o O n goinlgosses:8.7% -12.9% o An nual losses (at current run-rate): $220M-$320M o 20 20 losses: $1 30M-$190M

A purchase-frequency increase of 10% represents -50% priceelasticity (against 18-20% price reducbon). This is the expected upper bound of purchase-frequency increase, with 5'/o being a base case.

Revenue Implications of Price-changes

While we lack a perfect proxy for assessing price-elasbcily in response to a permanent price-change, wallet-sensibvity analysis suggests that purchase-frequency would not increase at a magnitude that ofhets discounts.

Assuming current trends for iOS and GP continue, a purchase-frequency increase of 5-1 0/o would produce 2020 revenue losses of: o O n goinlgosses:8.7% -12.9% o An nual losses (at current run-rate): $220M-$320M o 20 20 losses: $1 30M-$190M

A purchase-frequency increase of 10% represents -50% priceelasticity (against 18-20% price reducbon). This is the expected upper bound of purchase-frequency increase, with 5'/0 being a base
case.

EPIC 04041047

Communications Scenario: Game Blocked
In this scenario, players on Apple/Google will be blocked from accessing the app. Sentiment will trendnegative towards Epic.As players are no longer able to access Fortnite on their preferred platform, Epic will be seen as the instigator of a series of events that led to the title being blocked. Examples of anti-Epic messaging will be:
· Ep ic thinks they are SpecialP: layers and gaming press will point out that Epic thinks the rules should not apply to us. Does E ic reall thinkthe 'res ecial?
· Ep ic is GreedyS:ome players will think that Epic only seeks to profit off of Epic Direct Payment. Why else would we be implementinga new payment system? Wh does E icneed more mone ?
· Ap ple/Google Own the Platform":We welcome any developer that recognizes the value of Google Play and expect them to participate underthe same terms as other developers." (Google's December 2019 response to press)
How We Combat this Sentiment
· Emp hasize that savings from the new payment system are goindgirect to the player. · Pro vide a compellingfree incentive to all playersas an Epic "thank you" due to the downtime (free Battle Pass?). · Thi s is a step removed from the more directed nuclear alternativea:ccepting refundsfor all Apple/Google users. · Foc u s attention on the fact that we think Apple/Googlelegally do not have the rightto deny players these savings.

Communications Scenario: Launch
Expected Community Reaction at Launch:
Sentiment will belargely positiveamong the community at launch, as nearly all players will have a path to discounted prices. In regions where Epic Pay is unavailable, the community response will be negative. Smaller communities (r/fuckepic) will remain cynical, but will not have ammo to fight.
Expected Press Reaction at Launch:
Press headlines will lead with theupto20%savings,with more technical outlets highlighting the obvious payment
conflicts with Apple and Google. Initial articles will paint a picture of an impending battle between Epic and
Apple/Google regarding payment policies.
Proposed Epic Communications:
Our initial comm's will lean intoplayer savingsfirst, with a secondary highlight on paymentchoiceasbeing proconsumer. Leaning into choice too heavily, though, will expose us tohypocrisycomments with regard to our position on EpicGames Storeexclusives.Proposed announce blogcopycanbefound here.

Communications Scenario: Updates Blocked
In this scenario, all players can still access their content and friends on their preferred platform of choice.Overall
sentiment will be positive to neutral until a build update arrives that would split the community, with two core messaging
camps arisingamong coregarners:
· Pr o-EpicT:his group supports Epic's payment position as being pro-consumer, as they benefit directly from the passed-on savings. Nobody is denied access yet, and (almost) everyone is receiving the savings benefit.
· An ti-EpicT:his group is skeptical of Epic's position. They will begin to push the perspective that Epic is not the "little guy," that they should play by the same rules as everyone else, and that they are greedy.
Proposed Epic Communications:
Emphasize that Epic Direct Payment offersplayers greater savingsandchoice in how Fortnite content is purchased, and that we believe Apple/Googledonothavethelegal right to deny players these savings. Proposed messaging here.

Affected Partners
· Sa m s ung is the only current mobile partner with its own storefront and IAP solution · Di r ect Carrier Billing partners (current and future candidates), use the Epic Games Store as their
billing platform, so this move will not directly affect them
Addressing Samsung
· Sa m s ung is already requesting a renegotiation on the rev split for both Fortnite and all other game titles including Spyjinx (percentages have not yet been broached)
· Un t il we are able to share more detail regarding our broader strategy and plans, Samsung's interest in renegotiating the financial terms likely will not change

Public Perception
· Ep i c is not seen as the "little guy"; we are seen as being largely and extremely successful working within thecurrent model.Why do we need more money?
· Thi s "fight" is seen only for the benefit of "large corporations who want to pocket more money." o O utside of abstract concepts, they have not seen how this can benefit them, therefore they' re not inclined to or have any desire to take our side.
· Ep i c is not unique; we should have to play by the same rules everyone else does. We should not get an exception. We are not special. o E xample: r/fuckepic -"Do the reall think the 're s ecial?" o "We welcome any developer that recognizes the value of Google Play and expect them to participate under the same termsas other developers."(Google's December 2019 response to press)
· Pl a yers do not want to get caught "in the middle" of this battle. Any negative consequences for them (i.e. them no longer having the ability to play the game or friction in their experience) will be Epic's fault for pushing this cause.

Sure thing. Price elasticity will be the predominant determinant of outcome, so that should remain at the core of assumptions we make I can present it in a different way though, combined with iOS/GP outcomes and referenced against platforms. Revenue change (not total) is how I originally presented these outcomes -- feedback was to show totals. That's on 17-19. I' ll pivot back.

Rather than give ranges of possible elasticity, can you show here, or on another page, a bunch of assumptions (ones you feel a most likely) and resulting change (not new forecast, what is the delta) to revs by platform. He'd also like you to take the image I' ll paste here into account. Reassigned to Nate Adams
