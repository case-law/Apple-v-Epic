9 smart and useful features of Apple's iPhone ecosystem that make it hard to switch

Once yougetused to a mobile ecosystem, itcan be hard to switch. Here areseveral reasonswhy Apple has made ithard to switch from iOS toAndroid, whether ifsbecause you can't live without the features or becauseApple haslockedyou in.

When shopping for a new smartphone, looking just at the features of one specific model

comparedtoanother,oreventhecapabilitiesofonereleaseofAndroid to thatof

iOS doesn't show the full picture. While the online reviews may indicate that the

that does not necessarily make all Android phones better than all iPhones.

Apple cares about more than just creating a consistent and unique experience for each of
their devices individually. In my opinion, Apple has created a more complete and userfriendly ecosystem that encompassesmuchmore than the features or abilities of a single
phone. If your total investment in Apple is just a single iPhone, then switching between iOS and Android with each upgrade opportunity is not just possi>le; it is likely very probable.

However,ifyou havetaken fulladvantageofeverything Apple hastoofferiPhone users,
then switching platformsmaybe harder than you think For many iPhone owners, the question is more than just upgrading a phone to the next great thing. It is also about how

much one has totally invested in Apple as a whole. Here's a list of several aspects of Apple's complete ecosystem that I think makes the iPhone experience much better than
it could possible be on its own.

Shared Photo Streams for iCloud members only

While your own personal Photo Stream may be a convenience when it comes to

accessing your photos from multiple devices, sharing your best moments with other

iCloud members is certainly more rewarding.Likin and commentin on each other' s

thatyou cannot access any ofthese shared Photo Streams from outsideApples

ecosystem. So switching means that you will have to leave your shared memories behind

and convince your friends and family to share their precious life moments with you

elsewhere.

iMessage and Face Time friends and family

iMessa e is A l e ' s messa n s s t emthat in many instances --at least when its w~orkin -- can beused as areplacement toSMS messaging provided by cellular carriers. Like iMessage, Face Time is the video extension that enables one to call someone they know and see them live and in person. Both products certainly have their competition online, but convincing your family and friends that you communicate with regularly to switch services may pose more of a challenge. Not everyone has accounts with multiple competing services.

GameCenter Friends,Saved Game Data and Top Scores

If you are a gamer, you may have quite a bit more invested inGameCenter than you

think If your an avid iOS gamer, all of your online friends that you challenge and play

multiplayer games with are all GameCenter members. Your top scores, achievements,

rankings and more are all in GameCenter as well. This includes the investment you made

in purchasing the games as well as the ability touse our iCloud backu and restore our

Goo le Pla Games has added similar features, but you will need to start over with new

friends and establish yourself once again on the leader boards.

iTunes Mix and Match media libraries
It use to be that digital-rights management (DRM) locked all of your music to one

servicei,Tunes and your iPod. This has chan ed inrecent earsand your music libraryis
more portable than ever. Moving your entire music library from one service to another can be a bit of a challenge, but you can do it. However, unlike some of the other multiplatform music storage services like those from Google or Amazon, youriTunes Match music libra ca n only be accessed from your iOS device, not Android. And even though your music library may be liberated from DRM, the rest of your iTunes purchases
are not.From movies to television series and even the books you purchased from iBooks, they are all part of your Apple ecosystem. This is why you mustuse our iTunes account authorize all of our devices. There is no legitimate way from Apple to transfer your media collection to another platform.

AppleTV, AirPlay and AirPrint enabled devices

From speakers to a~ml i f i ers, Airport Express and of course Apple Ttr, streaming your
music,videos, and even your screen iscertainly easier when you have anA~irPla capable
device to stream it to. Even printer manufactures have been su or t i n A l e's A i r P rint interface for a while now. And that makes printing from your iOS device simple and easy. And if you happen to have multiple iOS devices in your house, switching just one device over can make supporting all of these peripherals problematic to say the least.

iCloud synced data and backups

It's not just Apple's iWork apps -- Pages, Numbers and Keynote -- that can sync

over from the iOS a s t o r e to the Mac a s t o r eS. ome of my favorites include mSecure,

iDraw, ByWord, OmniGraffle, PDFPen and MindNode to name a few. Sure, you can set

up a Dropbox account and sync a folder of documents, but that takes time to set up, and

does not take advantage ofOS X's Power Na feature. Power Nap is a power saving

feature where your Mac will continue to sync with iCloud, even when it is asleep.

Charging cables at work, home and in the car
Then there are the cables. So many cables. Travel cables, bedside cables, work cables and car cables. After you have lived in Apple's world for a while, you start seeing more and more charging cables appearing everywhere you live. First it was 30-pin cables and now it is Lightning cables (and even MagSafe for Macs). All such cables are exclusively Apple. Not to mention "Made for iPod" compliant docking stations that you may have at your bedside in the form of an alarm clock or a speaker stand in the living room. There is no "Made for Android" equivalent.
AppleCare+ protection plans

Cellular carriers are lookin for wa s to shorten the amount of time that you are 'stuck' with an outdated phone. Apple on the other hand has looked for ways to get customers used to updating every other release withtheir version of the "tick tock" strate . Add to this the extended A l e Care+ l an and you have a solid two years that you will want to keep your iPhone close to you. And AppleCare does not end with your iPhone, you can trackand manage allofyour Apple devices that areprotected under AppleCare.,a convenient way to manage all of your Apple devices.
All those iOS exclusive apps
Lets not forget ones investment in apps. For paid apps this works both ways. For Android owners, having an investment in paid apps that you use each and every day would be the same deterrent for switching platforms as an iOS owner. There are however a number of a s t hat are exclusive to the iOS latform And if it just so happens that one such app is an app that you use every day, then switching may not be an option you are willing to entertain.
After reading this, you can look back and see it in one of two different ways. Either you see it as a trap, locking you in to a life of limited choices, or you see it as Apple having thought of everything.
And no matter which way you see it, both viewpoints will admit that Apple makes taking advantageofeach and every one ofthese features as simple and easy as possible from the very first the moment you take your new device out of the box. Some will say that is by design to lock you in, while others will counter that it is all about making the customer experiencegreat.Ifyou areone who has taken fulladvantage ofallA pplehas to offer, you' ll find it hard to switch away, and you might not care.
