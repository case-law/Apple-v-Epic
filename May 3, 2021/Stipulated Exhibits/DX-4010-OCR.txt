We were aiming for 30%, but coming at 35% was okay from previous discussion. Gearbox should eat ingestion, they are doing the work. Looks closer to 36.5%. Net effect to us is -7% premium above normal console split to be in channel we don' t serve that should be both marketing and additive spend.

Their initial order covers $170M face value of cards for holiday selling season. My bet is (marketing aside) half that will be incremental above users currently buying generic platform cards; where we get less than full value of the console going into Fortnite.

Seems like an OK outcome to me to be in channel at a low premium vs the retail disks (also incremental revenue fromotherwiseempty channel) at a worse net cut to Epic.

Rolling internal for discussion. While these economics aren't great, it gets us the end result we are looking for. I will push to have Gearbox cover " freight / ingest / peg card ", but we have agreed Epic covers manufacturing.
