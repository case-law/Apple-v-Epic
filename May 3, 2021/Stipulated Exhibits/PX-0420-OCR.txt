Phil & Eddy, Matt and I met with Bill Holmes from Netllix (among others) today to hear the results of their IAP test in ten countdes. Here werethe takeaweys, es they conveyed them:

The good news: Netllix saw significant incremental volume from IAP: 37% of the subsafbers we captured were incremental to what they would have captured via web alone The bad news: Apple IAP customers have much shorter lives due to voluntary chum than non-IAP customers --resulting in our incremental customers being worth 30% as much as subscribers they capture themselves The bottom line: When you factor in our commission (12% net of transection costs) and our incremental customers' shorter lives, IAP is modestly prolitable (+4%) for them, but this may be optimistic (e.g., it exdudes the US, which is large and less likely to be incremental). Netllix compared their 4% profit to our 15% commission and suggested that we have an uneven balance of trade.

We pointed out a host of problems with Netllix's analysis, but they don't really matter because this was just a prelude to a negogiagion on their part. Netllix suggested ways we might lower our commission, which we shot down forcefully. Netgix also proackvely made dear that they have no intention of joining TV App.

We steered the conversation to the positive things we can do together to reduce voluntary chum, increase engagement for all their customers (whether IAP or otherwise), and confinue to generate incremental subscribers. The next step is for us to reconvene in a week or two to discuss these ideas, with the goal of reaching agreement on something that preserves their participation in IAP on principled terms prior to the expirafion of their exisfing deal in early September.

Please let us know if you have questions or suggestions on any of this. -Peter
