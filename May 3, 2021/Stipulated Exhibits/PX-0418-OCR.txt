Just FYI -- Kazaa announced a web-based streaming music service for iOS, but that they' re not planning to create a native iOS app due to Ihe 30% IAP subscription rev share.

Best,

They' re treating web apps as the innovative "solution" to circumventing the inwpp subscription rules. Doesn't make a lot of sense...

sharing tool Kazaa a couple of months ago, is trying to drum up some attention for the digital
a 'breakthrough' for iPhone and iPad (and Android) users because its service is now 'accessible on iOS devices' simply by visitingKazaa.com.
Atrinsic is very explicit about why it is not taking the usual route of creating and marketing a dedicated mobile app for the mobile platform(s): it is not pleased withA~le's recent
announcement that it will keep30'/g of revenue generated by new subscri tions and media purchases made within an i Phone or i pad app through itsAt~g to r e .
In addition, Atrinsic derides Apple's successful mobile app marketplace by deeming it "just one of many marketing and distribution channels" it already engages in (although there's never been an
official dedicated iOS app for Kazaa to my knowledge).
The company says users can sign up and pay for Kazaa by charging their subscription to a credit card, mobile phone or home telephone bill after visitingKazaa.com from their mobile phone's
Well, thanks for making a clear statement on the matter (Apple's subscription policies are, after all, an enormous issuefor music streaming service providers across the board), but how is that move
a breakthrough rather than a step to (even more) obscurity?
Needless to say, it's already quite difficult to compete in the digital music streaming business with dedicated apps for multiple platforms users can easily find through marketplaces like the App Store and Android Market, so having a Web-only solution in my mind only makes it that much
harder for Atrinsic to market Kazaa as a solid alternative to the likes of Rdio (which was ironically founded by the co-founders of Kazaa), MOG, Spotify, Rhapsody and many others.
Neverthless, Atrinsic COO Ray Musci proclaims that the company still intends to broaden access for Kazaa with new and dedicated apps, so that the browser is not the only way customers can access the music streaming service.
Which makes me wonder why they' re calling today's announcement a breakthrough, again.
I read an article on Seekin Al ha this morning that touted Kazaa's not having dedicated mobile apps as a potential stimulus for a strong comeback, which left me puzzled (even if the author of
that article owns shares of publicly-listed Atrinsic).
I simply don't see how not being available on the various mobile app stores, which are growing more popular every day, can help Kazaa cement itself as a leader or even a serious challenger in the cutthroat music subscription space. It's tough enough to get discovered by enough users to make the investment in developing and publishing mobile apps viable as it is -- going Web-only
merely makes it tougher on Kazaa, even if Apple doesn't touch its margins that way.
