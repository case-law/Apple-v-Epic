Alee Shobin, 1/30/2020

It might be interesting to show in flows (new accounts mobile daily) and out flows {churned players daily). This could be shown in a line graph for both and the goal would be to dose the gap. This would set up a very visual representation of where the impact from the activities you have listed along with the optimizations are being seen throughout the year.

"of Epic Games App

Summary:
 
 

Epi c Games App is currently preinstalled and discoverable on a limited number of devices because existing preinstall deals only applied to new, unlocked flagship device models Epi c Games App store installs are greater but due to significantly lower organic traffic than Google Play and OEM marketing campaigns focusing on Brand and Product sales instead of Content and Services, they only account for14%of total Epic Games App installs lifetime Sam sung ouffit promotions have been successful and generated biggest new player acquisition beats on Android, but Huawei ouffit promotions did not see the same level of success due to lack of reach and marketing support Pre i nstall install flow only removes one prohibitive security prompt from sideload install flow and still takes 18 steps while requiring users to accept "Sources unknown"

Open issues from 2019, ranked by severity
1. Memory Accounting Entitlement
o Con textXcode 9 bug allowed Fortniteto run on 2GB devices-Xcode10+ fixed that bug
o Re sultN:egotiated memory accounting entitlement with Apple so that Fortnite can continue running on 2GB devices - negotiation induded our commitment to ultimately get the game working on 2GB devices without entitlement OR drop support for 2GB devices (expected 30% decrease in DAU)
~Next gte s Apple looking to us for timeline for removing memory aooounting entitlement

1: All games were tested once as fresh installs on 12/11/2019 on iPhone X over the EPIC-SECURE network in CRIV. 2: COD: Mobile was released 10/1. 3: 1m 30s including BP video for FTUE 4: Does not include 'optimization' step.

Insights:
 Co m p IPAs are substantially bigger, reducing the size of additional downloads after players get in game
 FN ' s final download size is much bigger, causing first load to take longer than any download step of any competitor
Next Steps:
 Co l l ect more data on times with lower end devices 8 higher sample size
 Co l l ect greater granularity of patching steps, including into "optimizing" by device
