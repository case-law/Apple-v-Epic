Hey Phil. Circling back on the outstanding policy issues. Any new information?
Also - Tim was suggesting we come out to your offices and say hello to John Kodera. Be good to form a relationship, and welcome him to games. We' re available any time. Sound like a good idea?

Hey Phil. As proinised we pulled some data form our Fortnite player base in January. Keep in mind this is a small section of players (-2.5%) because we aren't publicly pushing the fact that PS4/PC crossplay even works.

As you can see, data is pretty similar to what we' ve seen with Paragon. Pressing issues at the moment:

1. crossplay/cross progression with mobile. We'd like to get the existing Paragon/Fortnite PC exceptions extended to iOS and Android quickly. We need to begin testing this for our launch.
2. voicecommsacrossplatforms. We'dliketoenablethisforbettercustomerexperience. We'll rnatch PSN'sprivacy settings-blockindividuals,block all voice, mute. Oncewehavethis-theplayerexperiencewill begreatand Epic will publicly push that we have crossplay PS4/PC.
Let me know what you think, and if you have any additional thoughts on the larger Epic plan.

Thanks for your time, Joe Kreiner Business Development, Unreal Engine, Americas E ic Games
