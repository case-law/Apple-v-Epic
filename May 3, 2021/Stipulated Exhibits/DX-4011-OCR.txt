Subject: Re: New iPad Pro with LiDAR scanner and ARKit 3.5

Hey Robert! The work to integrate the latest ARKit is well underway - I' ll check in with the engineer working on that today to get an update but I imagine we' ll have that integrated and in testing by the end of this week, ready for the 4.26 release later this year. Fll let Sebastien answer on thoughts on the Lidar/enterprise side - I' ve had some general discussion with folks
on that side but nothing concrete yet,

Hello, Checking in to see how things are going with ARKit 3.5 and if there are any use cases that emerged for the LiDAR scanner in enterprise or virtual sets.

We are ramping up for Virtual WWDC and I want to get UE in the best position for any opportunities that start to pop up:-)
Thanks,
