Well, getting approved pretty much makes them think that this model is blessed by us, unfortunately.

I guess the below is technically accurate since we let it on the store, but it sure sounds like we talked to them snd said this new model is blessed by us.

Bloomberg reports that Big Fish Games, a Seattle-based game publisher, "won approval fiom Apple to become the first to offer users access to dozens of titles for $6.99 a month." They point out that, until now, games have "only been available one at a time, requiring users to download individual applications."

They also should cop up with press that they bullshitted/lied in the Bloomberg story.

I can't tell if they were Irying to negotiate via press or if they are just idiots.

Yes, of course we are giving them a headsup. If Erik wants to be on the call with Anders, that' ll be fine. I honestly don't know what we' re going to say to this developer other than "We don't allow App
Stores within an app in our App Store"

Should we have somebody call them to give them a heads up and explain what happened prior to pulling it? Erik Lammerding is happy to make the call in Lucy and Paul Ramsbottom's absence. Lucy may be available, but I know Erik is for sure. Pd hate for there to be a backlash against us for pulling the app before giving them a heads up.
Tom - without a guideline to reference, we might want to hold off on comment for now...... that being said, Pll start a statement draft just in case, if it is a confirmation that the app has been taken down

I am removing their app immediately. I have no guideline to remove their app on, but have been asked by the ERB to hide it. I will be doing so immediately.
