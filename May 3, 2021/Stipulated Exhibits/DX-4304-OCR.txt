Re: Potengal mitigations / Pivots to discuss for Android Launch

This requires explicit whitelisnng for given server build (hotfix). We don't have required values (APK size & crc) for final build and will add those tomorrow, shortly after live launch,

Talking to ChrisB, since the Java code was not protected in the leaked intermediate build and the Java code

is doing the compatibility checks, it is quite possible for someone to disassemble Java, change code,

recompile/repackage APK and release a build that will "work" on an android device.

+ more people To Dan's question: I'm not convinced we can fully prevent the issues i flag above, even with Arxan and client detections in place. Plus we cannot prevent APK downloads from thirdparty sites. Also, some ofour protections have now leaked and might beeasierto bypass,and theXda developers/hacker coinmunity seem to be actively engaged already.
i' ll do some more investigations with the devs to get deeper insight on the risks, and keeping what happens in-live under close scrutiny

Listing a bunch of things that i think could very well happen, and mitigations:

· Seeing many thirdparty downloads/leaks/workarounds/backs o Samsung only required 48h exclusivity. Could we open up on Saturday? what' s the worst that could happen? o Could we entitle/mail the first group Saturday? o Any CCU concerns at all?
"/Signed up, butcannotdownload, howeveriseeyoutubesofpeopleplaying,i'mjust

(maybe show "unsupported phone" on the menu's etc). I started a discussion if we feel OK releasing this without able to fully test all potential devices worldwide.
· lots of partiesoffering "Unlock Galaxy skin" for you o share your Epic account with me, i will give you Galaxy Skin for $50 or something o we know about this hole, but some bad behavior can occur. Can we do anything here?
