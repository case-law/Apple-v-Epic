I think all your points are really really good - especially number 2.

There are certainly several reasons not to do it but there are also several reason to do this:

1. Our biggest opportunity for player and revenue growth ison iOS. Currently only 6% of our revenue comes from there. With controller support, and if Apple gets behind promoting that, we could see HUGE growth on i OS.

2. Apple advertising this might actually inake Spotify and others sit up and notice the market power we have in music and want to do deals with us. It will also inspire artists and labels to play ball as they' ll see as even bigger marketing promotions for their artists. Also having Apple
ADVERTISE YOUR PRODUCT doesn't suck and we' ve had our games in Apple ads, and on Apple's stages before.

3. We'd like to have Apple be the presenting sponsor for the Fortnite World Cup. Having a successful tie to Apple Music might help them think of Apple benefits outside of just the App Store.

4. This could give us soine more leverage with Apple which is always helpful!

5. I don't think this will have any negative reputational/authenticity affects to the Fortnite brand among players but it will get the Marshmello association out in a much bigger way.

6. Apple commercials are always tasteful and cool. They won't do soinething shitty with this.

My flight is supposed to land around 10:25 PST so I could jump on a call at I I AM PST. Feel free to put a hangout video conference on my calendar and let's talk this through some more.

Im definitely leaning towards Phil's sentiment on this one. Dont love at all that it feels like they are drafting on us. Also puts us 'playing favorites' with Apple right when we are about to
start doing lots of music stuff and may need to work with Spoti fy, etc. That said, agree with Ed that it is great exposure for Mello and (for the same reasons I would hope if we ever make original music) an 'expected' way for fans to get the music. But man I
hate the exclusive part.

Should we all jump on a hangout and chat through it?

Not sure no plan is player friendly. If people want to hear the music afterwards, we should give them an easy way to do it.

Actually adding Matt and Donald this time. I dont think we need to have a plan to listen to it after. Its a live event. Folks will stream and make replay but we as Fortnite arent hosting or sharing the music. Mello and team can do that.

let's set Apple's ask aside for a moment. What is our plan for fans to be able to listen to this music after the concert is done?

Adding Matt & Donald. Fm not feeling great about this. Essentially, we do an amazing thing, do all the work and
then Apple jumps on and sells the mix as a promotion. This is brand co-opting and drafting in our wake.

Sony has music. Would we have to do this with Sony? Spotify? etc...

I think we need to keep this about us and Mello and just say we are not ready to jump into a marketing promo like this.

As I inentioned, if they want to highlight this in their app store editorial feed and say "did you guys see what happened in fortnite yesterday? blah blah blah and then say "check out mello music here and download fortnite here, that is totally fine.

A tiines square billboard piggybacking on the cool shit we did feels slimy. We need to push them back to editorial feature AFTER the concert. Nothing inore. We have no business trying to help out Apple Music.

My stance anyway.
