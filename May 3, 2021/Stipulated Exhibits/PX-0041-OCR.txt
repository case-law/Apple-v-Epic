App Store Developer Study
Who did we survey? App developers for iOS, macOS, watchOS, or tvOS who were involved in business or marketing decisions of their company andhad atleastoneapp published on the App Store within the past two years. A two year range was used in an effort to ensure a large enough sample of respondents. For analysis purposes, developers were segmented into small, mid and large tiers. The App Store analytics team defined the tiers based on app downloads. The downloads were segmented into three tiers since the top developers contribute a large proportion of downloads The buckets were scaled in size -- 93rd and above percentile for large, 71-93 tor mid and 70th and below for small. The team
ted tr) understand if there were differences in results %)opera vnth different levels of downloads.
US, China, Japan
How did we reach them? Developers were randomly selected from the App Store Analytics team's database and invited to partimpate in a15minute web survey.

Notes Statistical testing was conducted at a p<0.05 significance level.
If data reported for large and mid tier groups is higher/lower than the corresponding value for the small tier tier group, it is indicated with a upward/downward arrow (1 t). To simplify reporting, results of statistical testing may not be shown tor values under 5%.
To simplify reporting, chart labels for values under 3% may not be shown The term "Top-2 box" refers to the total of the top 2 results in a 5-point scale. Totals, sub-totals, and neh may be off by a point or two due to rounding.
Respondentsc'omments to open ended questions were manually coded into categones. Some of these categories are predetermined, others are added as new themes receive a sufficient number of mentions. The percentages reported are calculated based on the number of mentions provided (a respondent may not provide a comment or may have provided more than one comment) dwided by the number of respondents who were shown the question.
