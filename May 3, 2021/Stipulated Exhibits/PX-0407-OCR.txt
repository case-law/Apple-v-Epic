Do you have any thoughts on how we would make switching to iMessage (Rom WhatsApp) compellingto masses ofAndroid users who don'thave a bunch of iOS 0iends? iMessage isa nice app/service, but to get users to switch social networks we'd need more than a marginally better app. (This is why Google is willing to pay $1B -- for the network, not for the app).
In the absence of a strategy to become the primary messaging service for to bulk of cell phone users, I am concerned the iMessage on Android would shnply serve to remove and obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.

Do we want to lose one of the most important apps in a mobile environment to Google? They have search, mail, gee video and growing quickly in browsers. We have the best messaging app and we should make it the induslxy standard. I don't know what ways we can monetize it but it
doesn't cost us a lot to run.

We really need to bring iMessage to Android. I have had a couple of people investigating this but we should go fuU speed and make this an oflicial project.

Google will instantly own messages with this acquisition.

Google is said to be well into negotiations with the team behind WhatsApp, with the search giant reportedly considering a $1 billion price tag for the popular cross-plafform messaging app.
Sources reportedly close to the negotiations tellDigital Trends that Google is looking to acquire the popular massaging app, and that W~hatsA 's team is "playing hardball," holding out for an acquisition price close to $1 billion. Bringing WhatsApp into the fold would likely provide Google
with a faster route to unifying its disparate messaging services -- Google Voice, Google Hangouts, Google Talk, etc -- making it more capable of competing in the communication
segment against Internet rival Facebook.
Such a service unification may be high up on Google's priorities list right now. Rumors have the search leader working on a project known as Babble, which would provide cross-plafform
communications between its services. The rumored WhatsApp negotiations could be a means of bringing an accomplished team into Goodie's own operations, as Goodie did when ita~cu ired o ulariOS mail a S a r r owin July.
Google is said to have approached WhatsApp in the past, broaching the topic of an acquisition in early December. Around the same time, Facebook wasalso said to be considering buying WhatsApp.
WhatsApp has proved immensely successful in the time since its release, netting tens of millions of users across Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and Apple's iOS platform. It is currently the second-most popular paid app in Apple's iTunes App Store, and the service saw18
billion messa es transmitted this past New Year's Eve.
Eschewing advertisements, WhatsApp has managed to pull in considerable revenues with a simple yearly subscription fee of $1. iPhone users pay that fee upon first downloading the app, though recent rumors have the service moving to a model more in line with its incarnations on other platforms. Users on other platforms can download and use the app for free for the first
year before being presented with the option to pay a $1 per year subscription fee. While WhatsApp has not released any details on its financial operations,Digital Trends' source says
the company may be pulling in roughly $100 million in revenue.
