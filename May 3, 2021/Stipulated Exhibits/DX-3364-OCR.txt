Making it more advantageous to buy on mobile than on Console is not an option.

I think the idea is for the exact same purchase price, a mobile player would get 18% MORE v-bucks if they chose our payment system vs. Apple or Google's payinent system. Although we won't offer console players
the choice to choose our payment systein over the console payment system, the ultimate net value to buying v-bucks on mobile using our payment system would be higher than all others. Kayla: Or, do you think I misinterpreted Tim's request?

We did agree to keep identical pricing across all platforms with Microsoit, Sony, and Nintendo. That being

said, all they care about is that we are not using arbitrage to direct sales away from their platforms. They

are entirely self serving, so making mobile less attmctive would likely work for them, If we kept this just

to mobile (and it was a fixed 18% higher that matched console, always) Fm sure we could talk it through

with console partners. Would want to notify them 1-2 weeks before implementing.

If we extended this to PC, it would be like dropping a nuclear warhead. They would consider that Epic

Hey Joe, I got a note from Tim asking us to explore, among other things, a mobile strategy of providing 18% more VBucks for Epic payment purchases versus mobile platform payment purchases. I suppose it might apply to PC too, and in theory instead of a value add to initial purchase could be a discount applied to next purchase (not sure it matters, point is to pass savings to player).

What are your thoughts particularly as it relates to navigating the 1st party console minefield?

Thanks, Ed
