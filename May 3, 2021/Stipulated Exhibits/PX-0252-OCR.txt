Allow me to express doubts about this "lot of work"... It's almost one year since we uncovered the l4 app hidden behind a calculator with loads of downloads, and if theyVe made any progress then it's just not visible.

Just like in October, AppReview fails to review properly, and we just temper with search results (which could be dangerous from a legal perspective) to trf to correct.

Any idea on how we can force them a bit7 Not only informing iTunes Moderafion - even though that's a needed thing so that it rings a bell when Irina and other folks see this kind of stuff high in rankings. Improving the review and prevenfing these apps from getffng on the store would be much preferred...
