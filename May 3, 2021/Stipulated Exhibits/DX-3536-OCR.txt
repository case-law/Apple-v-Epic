Dear Yves,

I'm writing to apologize for the shortcomings in our Epic Games store implementation and our Uplay integration.

In the past 48 hours, the rate of fraudulent transactions on Division 2 surpassed 70%o, and was approaching 90%. Sophisticated hackers were creating Epic accounts, buying Ubisoft games with stolen credit cards, and then selling the linked Uplay accounts faster than we were disabling linked Uplay purchases for fraud.

Fraud rates for other Epic Games store titles are under 2% and Fortnite is under 1%. So 70% fraud was an extraordinary situation.

To stop the fraud, we disabled purchasing of Ubisoit games. We will make our best efforts to restore service as
quickly as we can. This depends on (I) a real-time system for disabling refunded and fraudulent purchases on Uplay, and (2) anti-fraud itnprovernents in Epic's service. This work will likely take at least 2 weeks to complete.

The fault in this situagon is entirely Epic's, and all of the tninimum revenue guarantees remain in place to ensure our performance.
I'm sorry for the trouble,

Tim Sweeney Epic Games
