Other than the Wholesale Price or agreed revenue share, Publisher is not entitled to any other fee in connection with any Digitally Delivered Products. No further Wholesale Price or agreed revenue share shall be payable to Publisher where a User exercises an entitlement included with a Licensed Product (whether at purchase or at a later time) to download additional copies to other Systems or other compatible devices, whether by means of emulation or otherwise. Publisher may change a Digitally Delivered Product's Wholesale Price or Additional Terms by providing SCE with a revised Product Submission specifying the changes and the desired effective date.

15.2.3

at the times, and in the manner stated in the Guidelines, or as otherwise communicated to Publisher. Where any amounts that SCE must pay under this GDPA are based on SCE or Affiliate revenue, those amounts are calculated after deduction for consumption taxes (including VAT), duties, charges or assessments which SCE or an Affiliate may have to collect or pay with respect to the sale or licensing of Licensed Products. Applicable currency exchanges will be based on the Sony Corporation official rate, or such other independent third party currency conversion provider as SCE may adopt in its sole discretion, for the period in which the relevant Digitally Delivered Products are sold or licensed on PSN. If the total amount of refunds issued by the applicable SCE Company for refunded Digitally Delivered Products exceeds the amount owed by that SCE Company to Publisher in the relevant period, Publisher shall pay that SCE Company an amount equal to the difference. SCE may withhold sums equal to refunds it has made from any payments due to Publisher and withhold payment of any other disputed funds until such time as the parhes resolve any dispute. If requested by SCE, Publisher shall issue credit notes to SCE for all refunds shown in SCE's statement in the month following that in which it receives a statement from SCE itemizing the refund in question.

The relevant Digitally Delivered Products and the agreed price, if any, to be paid by SCE for the inclusion of such products shall be recorded in a schedule to this GDPA or otherwise in writing. Failure to provide any such Digitally Delivered Product in the agreed form and at the agreed time shall entitle SCE to a refund of any sums paid for such product as set out in the Guidelines or such agreed writing. Publisher shall not share under this GDPA in any revenue received by SCE or any Affiliate as a result of the operation of or related to PSN generally, including subscription revenue generated by PlayStation Plus, regardless of whether or not a PlayStation Plus subscription is required to access a Licensed Product or elements of a Licensed Product.

Pu b lisher AuditS. CE shall keep complete and accurate records to verify its calculation of proper payment pursuant to this Section 15.2, and shall preserve these records for a period of 12 months after this GDPA's termination, or two years after presenting the applicable periodic statement to Publisher, whichever is earlier. Publisher's acceptance of any accounting statements, records or payment under this GDPA will not preclude Publisher from challenging or questioning the accuracy of any statement or report during the Term and the 12-month period after this GDPA's termination. Publisher will give SCE specific notice of any objection to a statement provided under Section 15.2 within 26 months following the date on which SCE first sent the statement to Publisher, or the statement will become conclusively binding and Publisher waives any further right to object. If Publisher has a good faith and reasonable belief that SCE has not provided accurate information and owes Publisher payment under this Section 15.2 as a result, then Publisher may, upon describing in detail the basis for its reasonable belief and providing
objective evidence indicating that SCE has underpaid, request additional, supporting
documentation from SCE to verify the resale of Digitally Delivered Product to Users. If the matter remains unresolved, the parhes shall then attempt in good faith, for a period of not less than 30 days to resolve any dispute related to any statement or payment challenged by Publisher. If such dispute remains unresolved, Publisher may then, at its expense, hire a nationally recognized, third-party accounting firm, on a non-contingency fee basis, reasonably acceptable to SCE, to inspect, audit and make copies and summaries of and take extracts from, those portions of SCE's records pertaining to payments due or credits received under this Section 15.2. Publisher shall require an accounting firm performing an audit to execute a non-disclosure agreement with SCE in a form acceptable to SCE.
