What We' ve Learned

Market
Offer not competitive.
Facebook, Google and Yahoo have massive inventory and data advantages that enable more cost effective ad solutions.
Media sales increasingly
inefficient.
Available options for mobile advertising have grown exponentially, resulting in longer sales cycles and lower close rates. In addition to

Flawed Business Model
Content costs too high
Revenue share/content costs in the App Network, Radio and News require unlikely user scale (i.e. 3-4x increase in listening) to cover fixed costs of running the businesses.
Data required to create relevance.
Competitors operate unconstrained in capturing and using user data for ad targeting. Agencies demanding hashed user level integration and ID exposure for automated buying.

A ssum tions o r FY P an
Advertisers will choose economics over softer value propositions.
Majority of market is direct response focused making data 8 optimization the core marketing strategies.
Access to data internally at Apple becomes more restrictive for ad monetization.
Eliminating cross app data profiling for advertising constrains value of data poor environments like the App Network and Music.
Competition intensifies as large scale platforms begin and/or push limits in monetization & measurement.
Profiling and attribution become baseline expectations of marketers and agencies looking for media buying eNciencies and insights.
Monetization of News feeds and control of ad user experience important for Apple.
