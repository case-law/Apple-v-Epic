General o Should we consider shutting down app submissions by China Unicorn? They have 121 apps currently in the store, and submit more every week. * Canier billing, from a non-catrier, for the purchase of physical goods: may be OK, but bring all to ERB. * Pandora is adding IAP, but want to know if they can create an account for their fiee users. ERB stated that it was fine. o BT4 dc IOSS has new hardware that is non-MFI support. Should App Review ask for the hardware, or should we allow into the store without our reviewing the integration? Answer was to allow it into the store without reviewing the integration, for now. If we hear of quality issues, we should start reviewing it. * We do not want apps that are alternate stores for Web Apps
