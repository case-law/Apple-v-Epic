They do'n t have the cre'drt 'car'd &riling detarls. They don 't know really anything about them..

If you launch a website and it can access underlying functionality like maybe your contacts, suddenly every website you go to has the potential of stealing your information. S t e aling your data. And that's something that we want to disallow.
So a web app essentially is a website that you say make a web app version of this. A n d a ll that does is it takes all of these files, these HTML, these JavaScript files, and puts it into a small container, and it lives on the springboard, on the home screen, if you will, of your iOS device.
It looks like an app. I t ' s an icon. I3ut it's a web app. Y o u' re not going to have a lot of functionality there. Y o u c l ick it . I t ' s just like saving a Safari link on your desktop and launching an app. S o there's a lot of limited functionality. You c a n ' t d o a s mu c h t he r e .
