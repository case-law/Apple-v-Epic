Just a side note - this shows when those people clogged in* with a new version, not when they actually got the update from the App Store. A good percentage of people coming in "late" will already have received the update via automatic updates, It's hard to get that number, but anecdotally in the early days of mobile, when we oAen released crash fixes as enon-requiredh updates (e.g we did not proinpt you to update to play) we found that within 3 days about 30% of
players appeared to have received the new build, either via automatic updates or just from checking their update list themselves.

It looks like that shows (eyeballing) a quarter of players updating to the new release within under 2 weeks, while a larger chunk updates over the following week or two. Am I interpreting this data correctly or is there a different way we should look at it?

Hate to be that guy, but this is probably going to be a very hot topic question at a big Tim meeting toinorrow at 2pm. Any chance we can get a sense of an answer by then?

cc-ing Matt S just because he's in the same meeting and has some context on importance. Sorry for being vague on the meeting overall.

Thanks, this is high priority for a Tim meeting. Any chance in the short-term we can just get a quick take for the most recent client update (non-HF), about % of mobile MAU that was updated to latest update version after 9 days7

Aakash, to put an extra fine point to the question, in addition to the general question: We will launch 13.40 on Tue Aug 4th. By the time we hotfix on early morning Thu Aug 13th, what
% of active mobile players do we think will have updated to that build? By platform (iOS vs Google Play vs Other Android). Do we see any meaningful discrepancies by region/country?

Jon, Darren, We' re looking to get a better understanding of how quickly new players migrate onto a typical
mobile update.

Example: % of MAU with latest update N days after release

Would it be possible to get this info before EOW?
