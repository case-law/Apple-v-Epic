Yes, we'd be happy to share quotes on Metal, which had been a dream to work with compared to other things, and we' re happy to either share or support Apple in sharing any technical details about Fortnite performance optimization and feature usage on iOS and Mac (though we' re in pretty sad shape on Mac right now and ought not make a point of it unless we' re able to improve by then.) There's nothing we seek to keep secret regarding Fortnite features and performance on MetaL
If there's an opportunity for Fortnite inclusion in the WWDC keynote, we'd be happy to participate. However, given priorities it's not possible to do something large and unplanned, particularly with Fortnite and AR.

There' s a range of options we' d been thinking about from some quotes we could use in a session or possibly the afternoon Keynote, or a demo we could do in one of the sessions showing Fortnite running on a range of devices from iPhone to iPad to Mac (maybe on everything from MacBook+ eGPU to the iMac Pro), or possibly even technical "developer adoption" post-mortem section in our Metal technical session.
