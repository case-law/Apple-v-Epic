Withone APl (oursII we canmanage what is on our products and what is not. lf we open It up then we don t sign all apps, we cion t distribute all a s, etc. Which is the same as throwing out thewhole plan we have in place

When they have contacts in their app, these are only the contacts on
the iPhone and not a merge of contacts from Google, right'7 I think it
would be a really bad idea forsomethingthat looks like contacts to
have contacts not on that iPhone and could lead to eo le not using our contacts app at all. VVe may want to limit this in the license.

On a related. note, our apple stores (onlline and retail) are the only distributors around the worldl that decreased year over year in iTunes card sales.

I reiterated to the team that this is just a proposal to be evaluated against repeating the iTunes card we did last year and nothing is approved until all the decision makers meet and discuss the proposals
I do think the new proposal may be better than the iTunes card. It is about the fact that our life is better when ou have man of our devices (Mac, iPad, iPhone, etc all working together with tlhe a s and iCloud ecos stem (sorry this isn't crisp, we just talked about it today). The hope is to not only sell Macs and iPads to kids going to college but also increase the appeal of iPhone to young peopleaswell.Tlhe 5 offon each could be stacked (ex get $150 ifyou purchase aMac and iPhone).

Policy Drove Distribution Decision

PLAINTIFF

Third Party Applications on Mac OS X Embedded

Signing does not imply a specific distribution method and it's left as a olic decision as to whether Apple signed applications are posted to the online store, or we allow developers to distribute on their own.This policy is easy to enforce for applications which are protected by encryption (probably Fairplay), but for applications not participating in Apple DRM we will not be able
to use techriology to prevent thircl parties from distributing software they get signed by Apple, only contraictual limitations
would stand in the way.

Safety of Macs/macOS "In Their Own Words"

Because of this, Apple provides layers of protection to ensure that apps are free of known malware and haven't been tampered with. Additional protections enforce that access from apps to user data is carefully mediated. These security controls provide a stable, secure platform for apps enabling t housands of developers to deliver hundreds of thousands of apps for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS a l l without impacting system integrity. And users can access these apps on their Apple devices without
undue fear of viruses, malware, or unauthorized attacks.

Ron Okamoto
Vice President, Developer Relations
Q. Does Apple routinely negotiate the terms of the developer program license agreement with developers?
A. No, they do not. Q. I n fact, Apple presents the same developer program license agreement
to all developers who wish to distribute through the App Store, right?

A. To my knowledge, yes.

Thanks. Unfortunately, IAP being "optional" means that no one will ever use it.

As we discussed, we want you to come up with the next approach that will work for us and our developers.

HTML5 Poses Threat to Flashl artd the App Store

Throughout a large propojtion of Tech auirope postings there is an underlying thread or, more accurately, a common languag~ T M LS.

Just this weejf, it underpinsMmilla's challen e to Android and the rest;the website-buildin service of BaseKitand, perhaps, Adobe's decision to close its a s t o res.
Few outside the techie world were perhaps aware of HTMIL5 before April 2010 when Appile CEO Steve Jobs declared iPhonesandi iPads would never support Adobe Flash.

Food for thought:
Do we think our 70/30 split will last forever? While I am a staunch supporter of the 70/30 split and keeping l simp e an consis en across ours ores, don't think that 70/30 will last that unchanged forever. I think someday we will see enough challenge from another platform or web based solutions to want to adjust our model (already Google has rolled out a web in app purchase model at 95/5).
If someday down the road we will be changing 70/30, then I think the question moves from "if' tonwhen n and nhow". I'rn not suggesting we do anything differently today, only that whenever we make a change we do lt from a position of strength rather than weakness. That we use any suchi change to our advantage if possible. And thinking about this long in advance can only help to look at an eventual change as an opportunity (wl'th d8V8lop8rs, press, customers, etc).
Just as one thou ht once we are making over $1B a year in profit from the App Store, is that enough to t en t in a out a model where we ratchet down from 70/30 to 75/25 or even 80/20 if we can maintain a $1Bayearrunrate? n o w a i sc o n r oversia, Ius ee l up a s a no e r w ay o oo a e size o e
usiness, w a we want to achieve, and how we stay competitive.
Again, just food for thought.

It is a great example of the stuff we should have automatic tools to find and kick out of the store. I can't believe we still don' t. Many 1 starreviews, many mention "scam" and "fake".Then Ilook atthe developers other apps andI see the same issue repeated.
Please look into this. I expect we need to remove the developer from our program. (and PLEASE develop a system to automaticaliy find low rated apps and purge them!! )

App Review
· We release every week. When our app is rejected by review for something entirely unrelated to the changes we have made, it's extremely disruptive and throws us ofif our cadence. Please figure out how to let us proceed with the release and address the issue in the next week's release. I.e., give us a warning that something is wrong instead of bein a brick wall for us to run intoheadlong.
e The app reviewers are sometime arbitrary and unpredictable. The app reviewers ar not consistent amongst competingapps
a The review time has improved a lot, But developers could have a better mechanism in case of major bugs found in app that would need to be fixed and replace in the App Store in a timely manner. My suggestion would allow developers to bypass the review process in special cases and perhaps limit the number of times per year a developer can have these special cases. In this cases, when developers choose to bypass the review process, the app would still be reviewed after and if the review process finds that the app should be rejected the App Store would automatically ievert back to the last version. This way developers would be penalized if they abuse the bypass for example by publishing a version of the app that has features against the Apple's guidelines.
e The review process i arjbitrary. pplying guidelines consistently makes it easier tor developers to publish
apps. I recently had an app rejected when I only changed the license key for some third party software. The app has already been on the app store for several years, but it was rejected for the user experience (whichi didn't change at all in the update). So it took me about a week to rewrite the app and get it approved. In the meantime the existing license expired so our app stopped working. This caused a lot of frustration for our (Iand Apple s) Users.

Q. And if I remove the word "iPhone" and just ask you, are you aware of any information, which indicates how much the average consumer spends over the life cycle of a phone, does that change your answer?
A. No. Again, I mean, it may have been. I just don't recall anything like that.

Q. Are you familiar with any work that's done within Apple to determine the amount that a consumer
spends on apps over the life cycle of an iPhone? A. No. Not over the life cycle of an iPhone.
Q. Are you familiar with any work that's done within Apple that looks at how much the average consumer spends on apps on an annual basis? A. No, not on an annual basis.
Q. Are there any -- are you aware of any information that Apple provides to customers, estimating for
them what they are likely to spend on apps on any kind of periodic basis? A. I believe I answered that before, but again. No. We don't publish forward looking
things, we don't -- we don't read people's minds.

On Latency:
Q. [W]hat's your understanding of that term? A. It's basically the -- to put it in layman's terms, if I click a button, how long does it take for the response to
come back from the server. Usually measured in milliseconds. And so for things like gaming, it s really important because obviously if you' re moving around in a game, if it's delayed, it can signi6cantly impact the experience of the game. Q. And are you aware of any studies within Apple that have looked at latency issues in connection with streamed apps particularly with regard to game play? A. Again, I don't recall any. Q. Are you aware of any studies within Apple that have looked at any functional -- functionality differences between streamed appsand native apps? A. Again, I don't recall.

When they have contacts in their app, these are only the contacts on the iPhone and not a merge of contacts from Google, rightT I think it wouIcl l3e a I'cally l3ad idea fol something that looks like contacts to have contacts not on that iPhone and could lead to eo l e not using our contacts app at all. VVe may want to limit this in the license.
