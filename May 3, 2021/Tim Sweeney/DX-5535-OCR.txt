SlowTask leaderboard, TotalEditorStartup leaderboard by whether Live Coding is enabled and using Fast Load, and CPU InitializeEditor leaderboard. Can help identify bottlenecks and slow loads.

 Queriedfree holida ames b IP data to inform what rate limitation is most useful, The current rate limitation is 3 orders per IP in 5 minutes. The data shows over118Kaccounts who had daimed inofe than 3 orders in a single minute. The team is considering changing the threshold to a minute as a result.  Analyzed Xsolla payfnent methods in Korea and Indonesia, shorllisted payment methods with fewer transactions and high fees that can be removed.  Built a workbook formax s end er u rchase. Will help inform pricing decisions based on areas where we can infer the sensitivity curve.

Data Science:  ELO prediction model: finalized feature generation and target definitions.

Upcoming Projects to Flag:
 Coordinating with publishing, engineering, and community to solidify insight into MOTD impact, and perhaps introduce basic experimentation.  Building quest recommender proposal, to use data science modeling to recommend specific quests for players based on their history.  Strike team further investigating mobile funnels.
