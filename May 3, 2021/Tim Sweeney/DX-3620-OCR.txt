Dear Tim,
Thank you for your email.
We are ready to pick up the discussion when you are ready. If you would prefer, I can ask my team to brief you about the upcoming features in the Galaxy Store. This effort is led by Won-din Lee (copied) who runs services and partnerships for our company.
I hope you stay well and look forward to hearing from you.
Best regards, TM Roh

Epic would like to have a strategic discussion with Samsung in several weeks on a bold collaboration to change the status quo on mobile payments. Epic has taken the public position that mobile plafform digital distribution channels induding Google Play should be open to payment competition. Please allow us a few weeks to prepare our thoughts on how we might pursue thist~oether. Finally, we are very interested in learning more about the new features coming to the Galaxy Store that will accelerate game opportunities. Epic will soon announce a new generation of technology, Unreal

Engine 5 that we would like to demonstrate to Samsung. We would like to find more ways to partner on theinnovationscoming from bothourcompanies and to demonstrate new high-end Samsung devices through Fortnite and also Unreal Engine games from other developers. It is especially exciting to show that high-end western Xbox and PlayStation games can reach much larger audiences through Sarnsung devicesl

Dear Tim,
DJ has kindly forwarded your message to me. My name is TM Roh and I am the President of Samsung Mobile. It is very nice to meet you.
First, I want to thank you for letting us know ahead of time of your intentions to bring Fortnite to the Google Play Store and we respect your decision to do so. It is my hope that our two companies can continue ahead with our strategic partnership.

In light of your recent decision, I think we need to reassess the existing partnership terms to ensure that our two companies' interests are realigned. I believe that we can come to an agreement on a more realistic partnership model going foiward.
The Galaxy Store has mademany improvements and added new product features that will greatly improve publisher game performance and I believe your games will greatly benefit from these enhancements in our store. We will continue to invest in our gaming service, and I sincerely hope that we can continue to develop a strategic partnership with you to unlock these opportunities.
Best regards, TM Roh

Dear DJ,
I'm writing to let you know that Epic is officially submitting Fortnite to the Google Play Store. This represents amajor shift in our strategy on Android, because we have come to a key realization:
Google puts software downloadable outside of Google Play at a major disadvantage, through technical and business measures such as scary, repetitive security pop-ups for downloaded and updated software, restrictive manufacturer and carrier agreements and dealings, Google public relations characterizing third party software sources as malware, and new efforts such as Google Play Protect to outright block software obtained outside the Google Play store.
That said, Epic is in discussions with Google and Apple in which we are seeking the right to freely partner with payment processors on in-app purchases of digital goods in Fortnite and other titles. Given regulatory scrutiny on the topic, we are optimistic that progress will be made.
Epic desires to continue our partnership effort with Sarnsung in anticipation that future Android policy updates will enable Fortnite and other games to support non-Google payment services, including Samsung Pay, so that each service can compete on its merits.
We will continue to fully support both the Samsung Galaxy Store and the Epic Games Store on Android.
We are grateful for Samsung's ongoing partnership with Epic, and we hope that 2020 will bring significant positive changes in the Android ecosystem.
-Tim
