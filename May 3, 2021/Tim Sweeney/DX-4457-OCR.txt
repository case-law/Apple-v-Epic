Subject; Note 9 + Fortnite launch

Dear DJ, YJ, Thomas,

Thank you very much for all of your support for the successful Note 9 and Fortnite launch today! We are grateful for the faith Samsung has put in Epic to make this possible.

You have my assurance that Epic will support Samsung 10(P/o in any battle with Google.

We will not ever give in to Google pressure to support Google Play, even if Google blocks Fortnite on Android, and even if the battle requires litigation lasting many years,

Fortunately, our best defense is the love that customers have for Samsung phones, Unreal engine, and Fortnite. Though Google has threatened us in private, they are unlikely to actually retaliate, as that would be visible to all of our customers, the industry, press, and retptlators.
We' ll stand firm in our partnership to advance the whole industry together!

Best Regards,
Tim Sweeney Founder/CEO, Epic Games
