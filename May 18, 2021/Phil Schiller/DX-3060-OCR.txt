CUPERTINO,Califomni-Feebruar 15, 2011-Apples today announceda new subscription service available to all publishers of content-based apPs cn theAppStoreau, including magazines, newspapers, video, music, etc. This is thesameinnovative digital subscription billing service that Apple recently launched with News Corp.'s "The Dally" app.
Subscriptions purchased from within the App Store will bs so)d using the same App Store billing system that has been used to buy billions of apps and In-App Purchases. Publishers set the price and length of subscription [weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, bi-yearly or yearly). Then with one-click, customers pick the length of subscription and are automatically charged based on their chosen length of commitment (weekly. monthly. etc.). Customers can review and manage all of their subscriprions from their personal account page, including canceling the automatic renewal of ssutmcription. Apple processes allpayments,keeping the same 80 percent share that it does today for other In-App Purchases.
"Our philosophy is Eimpl~ he n Apple brings a new subscriber to the spp, Apple earnsa Sopercent share; when the publisher brings an existing or new subscriber to the app, the publisher keeps 100 percent and Apple earns nothing," said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "All we require is that, If a publisher is making a subscripdon offer outside of the spp, the same (or better) ofter be made inside the spP, so that customers osn easily subscribe with one-click right in the app. We believe that this innovativasubscription service will provide publishers withs brand new cpportunky to expend dicoital access tc their content onto the iPad, iPod touch End iPhons, delighring both new and ex)sting subscribers."
Publishers who use Apple's subscription service in their app can also leverage other methods for acquiring dhital subscribers outside of the app. For example, publishers can sell digital subscriptlons on their web sites, or can choose to provkle free access to existing subscribers. Since Apple is not involved in these transactions, there is no revenue sharing or exchange of customer information with Apple. Publishers must provide their own authentlcaticn process Inside the app for subscribers thai have signed up outside of the app. However, Apple does require that It a publisher chooses to sellsdigital subscription separately outside oi tha

spp, that same subscription offer must be made available, at the same price cr less, to oustomerawhoadshtosubscribe fromwithintheapp. In addition, publishers msy no longer provide links in their spps (to a web site, fcr example) which allow the customer to purchase content or subscriptiona outside of the app.
