When they have contacts in their app, these are only the contacts on the iPhone and not a merge of contacts from Google, right? I think it would be a really bad idea for something that looks like contacts to have contacts not on that iPhone, and could lead to people not using our contacts app at all. We may want to limit this in the license.

I just had a good conversation with Vic.
I let him know that they can keep contact searching and display in their iPhone app. He was very happy to hear that.
I also told him we would add street view to Maps by the end of the year, with a target of November. He would like this to be in the map tiles contract with "commercially reasonable efforts" language.
I told him we are open to discussing what it means to add Friend Finder. He wants to schedule a meeting in the next week with Phil and me to discuss the exact feature set. He says they have about three weeks to decide whether to launch it on other phones this year, or push back to next year.
Vic, Larry, Sergey, Eric, and others are meeting tomorrow at 11am to discuss this topic.
