Sorry Phil, just relaying what the general manager of Codemasters told me. They helpfully detailed their finances for the mobile version of the game for me. I think its an open question of how developers who have big initial 3D graphics investments can make their content work with mobile economics, one that Ocelot can hopefully begin to address.
Personally, I prefer the tilt gyro control for racing games over a gamepad, but agree that the infiastructure of steering wheels and competitive leagues make serious sim gaming a challenge on mobile.

"They will no longer be bringing F I games to iOS due to lack of profitability for titles with large amounts of development dollars"

That has nothing to do with it.

A mobile racing SIM that users pay for up lieut isn 't going to be popular, period. Not on iOS, not on Android, not on Switch either.

The experience of driving games on a phone or tablet isn 't ideal (no wheel or controller, holding a small display, not on a loud speaker system, etc) and the business model is not what most users want for mobile games (and F I sucks as a sport now anyway).

F 1 2017 came out for Windows, macOS, and game consoles at the same time on August 25th. I' ve had a call with the developer of F 1 games (Codemasters), and they will no longer be bringing F 1 games to iOS due to lack of profitability for titles with large amounts of development dollars. F 1 2016 was the last annual Fl game for iOS, which we featured in our iPhone 7 keynote.
Thanks, Cameron
