Cicilline (D., R.I.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee,

kicked oftfhehearing by declaring: "Our founders would not bow before aking.Nor

should webow beforethe emperors oftheonline economy."

The executives defended their companies' practices and said that they face stiff competition that forces them to serve customers and innovate.

Lawmakers whipsawed betweentopics,from how the companies moderate socialmedia posts to the tactics they used to gain sizable positions in markets from digital advertising to e-commerce. The CEOs had sought to testify jointly, an approach that made it harder for the interrogators to sustain pressure on any one witness.

Mr. Zuckerberg faced a series of questions about Facebook's acquisition strategy. Mr. Pichai defended Google from a litany of accusations, ranging from taking advantage of its dominant online search engine to its work in China.

Lawmakers inboth parties accused Mr. Bezos ofpresiding over bullying ofindependent sellers on the Amazon marketplace, citing reports in The Wall Street Journal that employees had used seller data to launch competing products.

Apple got fewer questions than the other companies, with Mr. Cook defending its policies on its App Store.

Republicans appeared more skeptical of an antitrust crackdown, with the top GOP member of the subcommittee, Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.), saying he wouldn' t support a change in competition laws to deal with large tech platforms.
"In America you should be rewarded for success," he said.
GOP lawmakers directed a series of questions at Google, and to a lesser extent Facebook, for a perceived mistreatment of conservatives on social media. "Big tech is out to get

conservatives," said Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio). "If it doesn't end, there have to be

consequences."

PresidentTrump also weighed inon the topicWednesday, tweeting, "IfCongress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders."
The CEOs rejected the accusations, saying they strive to remain politically neutral and focus on serving consumers, not denying access to rivals.
Mr. Bezos,in hisfirstappearance before Congress toldlawmakers about how hismother became pregnantwith him when she was inhigh school and how he was adopted at4 yearsold by hisCuban immigrant father.Mr. Bezos also talked about his decision to leave a Wall Street job to start Amazon from a Seattle garage.
"The retail market we participate in is extraordinarily large and competitive," he said, addressing broader concerns about Amazon's power. "There is room in retail for multiple winners."
Rep. PramilaJayapal (D.,Wash.), who has Amazon's headquarters in her district,asked Mr. Bezoswhether Amazon employees violated an internal policy against accessing data from independent sellers.

"I can't guarantee you that this policy has never been violated," Mr. Bezos said. He said Amazon wantsthird-party sellers tosucceed and benefitsw hen consumers have more options.

"This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were

designed to prevent," Mr. Nadler said.

"I think the FTC had all of these documents" when it reviewed the acquisition for compliance with antitrust laws, Mr. Zuckerberg shot back, referring to the Federal Trade Commission.Some FTC officialsin 2012 thought the deal raised antitrust concerns, but they worried they might not win an antitrust case in court if they sued to block the deal, the Journal reported last year.

What factors do you think Congress should consider when deciding if a big tech companyis anficompefifive? Join the conversation below.

Mr. Zuckerberg defended Facebook's efforts to regulate false information on its platform, denying that the company has a dominant market position or profits from misleading viral content. He said new competitors are emerging all the time. "History shows that if we don'tkeep innovating, someone willreplace every company here today,"he said.
Mr. Cicilline accused Google of abusing its position as a web gateway, saying it changed "from a turnstile to the rest of the web to a walled garden." He quoted one internal memo that hesaid showed Google employees discussing how other websites had "too much traffic."

Mr. Pichai said he wasn't familiar with the specific document, but he pointed to competition in online search, such as searches for specific items on travel or retail websites, a sector known as "vertical search." "When we look at vertical search, it validates the competition that we see," he said.
Several Republicans criticized Google for abandoning some work with the Pentagon, and repeatedconcerns among some in the Trump administration about the company's work in China.
"It seems to really call into question your commitment to our country and our values," said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.).

Mr. Pichai said the company doesn't work with the Chinese military. "Compared to our

peers it is very, very limited in nature," he said of the company's work in China.

Apple got fewer questions about China, despite its large presence there. Rep. Hank Johnson (D., Ga.) questioned Mr. Cook about whether Apple treats app developers equally, echoingcomplaintsfrom app developers about Apple's market power. He cited Apple's moves totake alower cut ofsome App Store sales from Amazon and to allow China's Baidu Inc. to fast track app approval.

Mr. Cook stood by Apple's defense that it treats every developer the same and cited the opportunity provided by the App Store's growth. "If Apple is a gatekeeper, what we have done isopen the gate wider," Mr. Cook said.He acknowledged thathe didn'tknow about the Baidu situation and said, regarding Amazon, that lower rates are available to "anyone meeting the conditions."

The hearing was marked by lawmakers interrupting witnesses before they finished their responses. Mr. Bezos' video feed went out early in the session, causing Mr. Cicilline to call a recess. At the outset, instead of asking the witnesses to stand and swear to tell the truth, Mr. Cicilline had a different request: "Unmute your microphones and raise your right hands."
