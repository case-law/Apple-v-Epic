Dear Tim
My name is ~ an d I'm one of the founders of KnowledgeRocks - a company that deals with music, education and technology. We are developing products for the Apple Platform and have now submitted our latest application to the iOS review team following 3 years of development
We have been originally rejected in May as our in-app store was too similar to Apple's own app store, and have immediately redesignsd our store fine tuning it to the published guidelines. Since re-submitting the applicafion in June, we have been rejected again for the same reason, although our team has made the upmost efioit to digsrentiate our store from Apple's own.
Although we have communicated for ths past 3 month with your review team, and illustrated that your guidelines have been met, we have had nothing but promises to clarify the latest rejection. We have also escalated this to a full dispute, but not heard from the app-review teem with any explanation cf why our latest design is offensive.
The last communication from the app review board was to say the we will get a reply within 7 working days, which again we did not.
We have a very promising product, which is based on a US patent we own, and is done in conjunction with Faber Music, one of UK's largest sheet music pubfishets.

We really don't understand why Apple is treating us with such lack of respect, while we assume that our goals should be the same - to make business using Apple products.
We have tried any imaginable way to get some feedback and help us to release this product. In desperation I'm writing to you directly hoping that something can be done to resolve this unfortunate situation.
Thanks in advance.
Kind Regards

Director KnowledgeRocks Limited
