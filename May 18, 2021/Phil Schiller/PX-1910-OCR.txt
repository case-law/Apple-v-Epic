Chairwoman Klobuchar Opens Antitrust Hearing on App Stores Emphasizing Need to Ensure Competition in Digital Economy - News Rel...

Well good afternoon everyone. Sorry we are a little late but we had a vote this afternoon, and thank

you, Senator Lee, for working with me and our two staffs together on this hearing. I call to order

this hearing of the Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights. The title of

this hearingis "Antitrust Applied: Examining Competitionin App Stores."

I welcome our witnesses.

In ourhearing,we'regoing to examine the scope ofAmerica'smonopoly problem and discuss what should be done to protect and foster competition in the twenty-first century. Today, we will focus on competitionin what we call the "app economy."

We will discuss competition relating to the mobile applications that run on our smartphones, includingrevenues generated through app salesand in-app purchases,aswellasapp-related ad revenues and sales of devices designed to run apps.

In 2020, global app revenues have been estimated at more than$580 billion -- and they are projected to grow to more than $900 billion by 2023. In just the first three months of this year, users are estimated to have spent $21 billion on apps from Apple's App Store and around $11 billion on apps from Google's Play Store. Those are billions not millions, and that's 40 percent higher than last year.

This is a huge business, and it's growing and it's growing fast. There's nothing wrong with that, but whatis wrong is if we don't have competition.

Usersspend about 90 percentoftheirsmartphoneinternet time on apps. Consumers cannotget thesame functionalityfrom a webpage as they canfrom an app.

So whenyou'retweeting,orbrowsing theweb, ormapping your location, orlooking ata newsfeed, or listening to music --you' re almost always using an app. To put thingsin perspective, in the first threemonths ofthisyear,Americans spent an average ofmore than four hours aday,SenatorLee, on mobile apps. Do you think you were higher or lower? Okay.

Practically all of the apps used by consumers today are either pre-installed on Apple devices or devicesrunning Google'sAndroid operating system, or downloaded from Apple'sApp Storeor Google'Pslay Store,depending on theconsumer's device.

Apps designedfor theiPhone cannot run on an Android device-- andAndroid apps cannot run on

an Apple device. So there are two separate app ecosystems --Apple's and Google's, with each setting

all the rules and extracting commissions.

And consumerschoose which ecosystem theywant to usewhen they buy theirsmartphone -- ifthey buy an i Phone, they are with Apple for as long as they use that phone. If they buy an Android

phone, they are with Google for the life of that phone.

As consumers don't replace smartphones very often because they are so expensive, app developers who wanttoreach consumers on both types ofphone must createtwo versions oftheirapps one forAppleand one forAndroid.

And the only practical way for app developers to reach those customersis with the permission of Apple or Google.

Unlessyou aresome kind ofcomputer hacker,which we hope you'renot,theonly way to download an appontoyouriPhoneis through theApple App Store no otherapp storesareallowed and downloading apps directly from theinternet to avoid the App Store, a process known as "sideloading,"is prohibited by Apple. In every sense, it's what we call a "walled garden," and by design the App Store has a literal monopoly on the distribution of apps on Apple devices.

While Google does allow alternative app stores and sideloading on Android, as a practical matter, the overwhelming majority of app downloads take place on the Google Play Store, making it, by far, the dominant app store on Android devices.

Both Apple and Google maintain strict control over their app stores. They decide which apps can or cannotexiston theirapp storesand settherulesforhow apps operate once they aredownloaded. As a result, Apple and Google operate as "gatekeepers" with the power to decide how or whether apps canreachiPhone and Android users.And atthesame time, they offermany apps that compete directly with those sold through their own app stores.

Of course,thisgatekeeper power can and oftenisused toprovide a secure environmentin which legitimate apps can be distributed to consumers. But today, we will focus on how Apple and Google can use their power to 1. exclude or suppress apps that compete with their own products, and 2. charge excessive fees that affect competitionin the app economy.

As vIe'said before,justbecause a company createsasuccessful,innovativebusiness that consumers like, doesn't giveit a free pass to harm competition or ignore our antitrust laws.

Both companies also offer their own apps that compete with the third-party appsin their app storesi,ncluding video streaming apps,music apps,payment apps,gaming apps,and more.

In some cases, Apple and Google can build the functionality of a third-party app into their

operating system or build an app thatis essentially a copy --Apple's App Store terms explicitly allow

them to imitate any of the appsin their store, a practice known as "Sherlocking," which can render

the original competing app obsolete.

Both companies also compel app providers that sell digital content or servicesin their app to use theirpayment process services.Thecompanies then charge commissions ofup to30percent,that's right, 30 percent, for such "in-app purchases." The apps are not allowed, and thisis something that people don't know, to inform customers of or link to payment methods outside of the app to avoid the commission. In other words, consumers are banned from finding out, if they' rein the app, that they have a cheaper alternative.

Of course, we acknowledge that most apps are not subject to these commissions. Most small developers and those that offer apps that sell "physical goods or services that will be consumed outside the app"- like rides on Uber -- don't pay the commission. And they are probably pretty happy about that. That's fine.

But focusing high commissions on apps that charge for digital services used on theiPhone ensures that the commissions target on the very apps that are most likely to compete directly with Apple's and Google'sown offerings.And some a+ ectedapp developers arecomplaining that beingforced to use these payment services with their high commissions are crippling their ability to compete with Apple and Google products on equal terms.

So justbecause most developers arehappy because they aren'tpaying commissions, thats'fine,it doesn'tinoculate the app stores from the antitrust lawsif they are harming competition with other developers.

Some developers have also raised concerns about the app stores'abilityto demote their placement in app store rankings; to banish their apps from the app store; to withhold or delay approval of app updates, which can limit app functionality; and to set their own products as automatic defaults.
And when we talk aboutincentives, it' simportant to remember that the app stores aren' t supporting businesses thatjust cover the cost of operating them. In 2020, consumers are estimated to have spent $72.3 billion in Apple's App Store and $38.6 billion Google's Play Store. Applying their standard commission rates to these amounts nets Apple and Google billions of dollars.

Theseconcerns have attracted theattention ofenforcersin America and around theworld. We have seen significant reports on thisissue from governmentsin Europe and Australia, in addition to

the HouseAntitrustSubcommittee'sdigitalmarkets report.Therehave also been news reports of investigations by the Justice Department and state attorneys general into app store competition.

And state lawmakers in Arizona, Massachusetts, North Dakota, my home state Minnesota, and other states have proposed legislation to regulate app stores.

And although we can and should use our existing antitrust laws to address these issues, we can also strengthen our laws, including with my bill, the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act, and the exclusionary portions of that bill would be very helpfulin taking on these cases. We alsohave tomake sure theagencieshave theresources to takeon thesecomplex matters, which have taken me a quite a few minutes to even get to the guts of explaining this, but I thought it was really important to do. But you can imagineif you' re actually taking on the world's biggest companies that we' ve ever known in the world, you actually have to be able to have the resources to do that, so thatis actually tied in with this, as are all antitrust matters before those agencies. They haveto have theresources.Theyjustcan'tdo thiswith ducttapeand band-aids.

We all appreciate app stores and the roles that Apple and Google have played in helping to create many ofthe technologies that have defined our age. Thats'great.We 'renotangry about success. We simply want to make sure that capitalism keeps going in a strong, strong way that's fair to everyone, yes, but capitalism is about competition. It's about new products coming on. It's about new competitors emerging. This situation, to me, doesn't seem like that's happening when you have two companiesreally each dominating in d/fferentareas and where you have companies that are simply trying to do businessin their own ecosystems or maybe with Apple and Google that are severelyhampered from doingit.

So with that, I turnit over to Ranking Member Lee and I look forward to hearing from the witnesses.
