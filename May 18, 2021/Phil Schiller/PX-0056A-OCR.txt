App Store Review Guidelines "
Introduction
We' re thrilled that you want to invest your talents and time to develop applications for iOS. It has been a rewarding experience -- both professionally and financially -- for tens of thousands of developers and we want to help you join this successful group. This is the first time we have published our App Store Review Guidelines. We hope they will help you steer clear of issues as you develop your app, so that it speeds through the approval process when you submit it.
We view Apps different than books or songs, which we do not curate. If you want to criticize a religion, write a book. If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical app. It can get complicated, but we have decided to not allow certain kinds of content in the App Store. It may help to keep some of our broader themes in mind:
 We h ave lots of kids downloading lots of apps, and parental controls don't work unless the parents set them up (many don' t). So know that we' re keeping an eye out for the kids.
 We have ove2r50,000 apps in theApp Store.W e don't need any more Fart apps. If your app doesn't do something useful or provide some form of lasting entertainment, it may not be accepted.
 If y o ur App looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you' re trying to get your first practice App into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.
 We w ill reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court justice once said, "I' ll know it when I see it". And we think that you will also know it when you cross It.
 If y o ur app is rejected, we have a Review Board that you can appeal to. If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.
 Thi s is a living document, and new apps presenting new questions may result in new rules at any time. Perhaps your app will trigger this.

Lastly, we love this stuff too, and honor what you do. We' re really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents and make a living too. If it sounds like we' re control freaks, well, maybe it's because we' re so committed to our users and making sure they have a quality experience with our products. Just like almost all of you are too.

Living document
This document represents our best efforts to share how we review apps submitted to the App Store, and we hope it is a helpful guide as you develop and submit your apps. It is a living document that will evolve as we are presented with new apps and situations, and we' ll update it periodically to reflect these changes.
Thank you for developing for iOS. Even though this document is a formidable list of what not to do, please also keep in mind the much shorter list of what you must do. Above all else, join us in trying to surprise and delight users. Show them their world in innovative ways, and let them interact with it like never before. In our experience, users really respond to polish, both in functionality and user interface. Go the extra mile. Give them more than they expect. And take them places where they have never been before. We are ready to help.
 Apple, 2010
