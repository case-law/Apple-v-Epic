%e'll investigate these two app complaints and resolve them.

In the end it all really comes down to whether we will ever open up the iPhone for developers to distribute apps on their own. bypassing our store.

As long as we have a store. we have to revdew apps that go in it, we can't just let anything on an app store that has Apple's name on it.

And as Iong as there is about l0,000 apps+ updates coming through a week there will always be somesmag levelofhuman error.

Also, last year vve rejected the idea of publishing the rules and guidelines used Io review apps. it's very long «nd complicated but I think there will come a time where wc arc bcttcr served to
publish them than not, AI least we would be more transparent and some ol'the issue would be reduced (not allk

Subject: App Stare Disappointments

Dear Steve,

I wanted to write to express my disappoimment in the App Store approvalprocess.Iam not even an iPhone developer,butIhave been
inconvenienced many times by these issues. Let me give you two examples. These are the two apps that I use most frequently, but due to delays and tnistakes in the approval process, I now cannot use either of them.

Rg 6 Player is an app that grabs RSS Feeds and allows you to play embedded sound Ilies. I used this so frequently, I put it in my dock.

An update to the app was submitted, was accepted, but due to a signing error while putting it in the App store, people who purchased it weren't able to download it (and people like me who needed to remove and reinstall it were not able to get a nevv copy). The developer tried to get Apple to correct the error, bui in the end, he was given no choice but to resubmit thc app. Now the new submission has been rejected because of a teeny tiny picture ot'an i phone displayed for two seconds as part of the intro screen that has been present in all previous versions. This means that people who paid for the app over three weeks ago will still not be able to use it for at least another week.
Parallel Kindgoia is a great cross-platform multiplayer online game, but it has taken longer than three weeks to approve the newest expansion.The app was submitted forapprovalovertwo weeks before the release date of the expansion. The release date has come and gone, so Android users are novv able to get in theIvtMO's new version to expand their territories and advance in the game while we iPhone users are locked out and will be forced to play catch-up when the app is finally approved.
I am beginning to regret getting an iPhone. I really likethedence, but Vrn starting to feel that it's a little crippled by the app store. and I'm beginning to look at people with Android phones and drooling a little. I get a new phone about every year or two. If my next phone is going tn be another iPhone, something has got to be done to improve the approval pmcess.
Thank you I'or your time.
