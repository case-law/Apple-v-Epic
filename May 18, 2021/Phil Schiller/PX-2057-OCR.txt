Wow, you guys are ahnost trying to piss off developers. From making a splashy intro for iOS extensions at WWDC to now where they 're being arbitrarily rejected (even after being approved!). None of this appears to make any sense.

My iepr n n r r yb d C e K y t eppt n ~

, b b ep rm r y j i d

even though 1know itwould be usefulforsome ofmy business users.PCalc was approved and

then rejected and then somehow approved again. The Draiis Today widget is now being

rejected even after several successful reviews. The developer forums along with dozens of news

sites highlight other fiustrated developers.

The guidelines are vague. Why not just allow users to decide what they want on their devices? Use App Review to keep out malwsre, security risks, offensive material, etc. but there 's no reason to filter out useful extensions.

Certainly it's put me off even considering touching WatchKit. The review process is just too b roken and arbitrary to invest any more of my time into this... : (
