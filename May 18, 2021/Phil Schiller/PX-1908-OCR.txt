The House Judiciary committee confirmed it's launching an antitrust investigation of the tech industry, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Chairman Jerrold
Nadler said: "there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications."
Stories lead with a focus on potential investigations of Facebook and Google, with some noting Amazon and Apple could also be targets.

This follows earlier reports suggesting DoJ and FTC have divided jurisdiction over potential antitrust probes into the big four tech companies, with DoJ taking Google and Apple "as part of a broader review of whether technology giants are using their size to act in an anti-competitive manner."

On Mad Money, Cramer argues Apple "needs some special protection and treatment from the President when it comes to goods manufactured in the People's Republic, but after to day it's hard to believe they' re going to get it."

Separately, speaking at the OECD in Paris, Vestager commented on the power of plafforms and highlighted the need to "keep that power under proper democratic control." Apple was not mentioned in her prepared remarks, but she raised concern about when "the very same business becomes both player and referee, competing with others that rely on the plafform, but also setting the rules that govern that competition."
In comments to reporters on the sidelines of the event she said her team is waiting to

hear from Apple in response to Spotify's complaint, and according to Reuters added, "we have been asking questions around in that market but of course also Apple themselves, for them to answer the allegations. And when they come back, we will know more." Politico suggests Vestager made this comment about a complaint made in April by two parental control app developers - Qustodio and Kidslox.
