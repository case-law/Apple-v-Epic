E.U. announces antitrust inquiries into App Store and Apple Pay
The European Commission announced less than two hours ago that it has opened two antitrust investigations into Apple, one involving rules for developers on the App Store and the other related to Apple's conditions for integrafing Apple Pay into xnerchant apps and websites.
The first investigation will look into the xnandatory use of Apple's proprietary in-app purchase system, and the inability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of cheaper altexnafives. eIt appears that Apple obtained a 'gatekeeper' role when it comes to the distribufion of apps and content to users of Apple's popular devices," Competition Comiuissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. "We need to ensure that Apple's rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers, for exaruple with its music streaming serviceApple Music or with Apple Books." The second inquixy focuses on Apple's terms and

Both the Journal and CNBC say the Commission has the power to impose fines and require changes to tech companies' business practices. The New York Times highlights the fact Brussels and Washington are "scrutinizing the power of the world's largest technology platforms," including Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, "over their growing power, particularly their position as gatekeepers upon which other companies depend on to reach customers." And Business Insider calls the App Store probe is "a big step forward for smaller Apple competitors." (WSJ ~ CNBC ~NYT ~Business Insider)
Most online reports so far feature little commentary, however, and almost all include at least part of Apple's statement. Articles note the complaint Spotify filed last year, and while the Commission's announcement today didn't identify the e-book distributor that filed a complaint, The Financial Times published an article overnight identifying it as Kobo. Almost all articles mention the research Apple released yesterday showing that the AppStore generated $519 billion in sales and commerce in 2019, with more than 85 percent going to independent app developers and other businesses selling through apps.

In an Op-Ed for the Fox Business website, Stephen Moore, a member of President Trump's Economic Recovery Task Force, argues against greater regulation of Silicon Valley, saying tech companies have helped the American economy stay afloat during the Covid-19 crisis. "High tech isn't swallowing up small businesses, it is saving them," he writes. "Thanks to our multi-trillion dollar tech sector -- and not just big tech, but hundreds of new entrepreneurial online servicescommerce kept flowing, food was available on the shelves, gas in the tanks, packages were delivered, and paychecks processed.
