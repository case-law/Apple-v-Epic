We spoke about this last week and I shll think it is a homble idea.

There are many APls out there for apps. By the same logic why not let Sun have Java on the iPhone? Why not Adobe's Air? Why not Micrceoft's Stiverlight? Why not Oualcomm's Brew? eic etc

Wtth one API (ours} we can manage what is on our products and what is noL If we open it up then we don't sign all apps, we don't distribute all apps. etc. Which is the same as lhrowing out the whole plan we have in place.
Anti in the grand scheme of APIs we could cheese to supporl beyond our own. if we ever did support another (which I don't recommend}. Yahoo's Widget API is not even close to the most important one we would pick. some of the ones I listed above (like Flash} are way more imporlantr valuable to us.
Besides, we have a way to do Widgels that competes with theirs. so who cares? This sounds like a relationship issue not worth constdedng.

place

With one API (ours) we can ma not. If we open it up then we don't sign all a all a s, etc. Which is the same as throwing out the whole plan we have in place

Besides, we have a way to do Widgets that competes with theirs, so who cal es?
