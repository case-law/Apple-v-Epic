Hi Bob,
I've not heard back re:the Exec Proposal.
On getting the revised Kindle App (they removed the in-app commerce), they were in final QA this weekend and they found a bug, so they areu't ready to upload. They will fix that, QA and be ready to upload somenme this week. (hopefully in the next day or two). I' ve asked him to let me know the second they upload.
I' ve just sent a draft of their press release for that along to PR. It came in today. I' ll keep you all posted.

That's great. Cindy is point on assisting with the launch of the current app. She is standing by. The best way to grease the skids is to get her a build asap.

Submitting Monday and launching Tuesday is difficult but we will do what we can.

As you suggested, I am copying Bob as I understand you are currently on

vacation.

We updated our Exec team following our discussions on Tuesday. They need

time to think about it and discuss (a lot of our key folks are on the road

due to the Kindle 2 launch), I should be able to get back to you next week

on your proposal. In the meantime, our management really wants to proceed

ASAP with the launch of the store-less app following your guidance from a

week ago.

We are on track to GM the store-less app on Monday next week and want your

help in getting it launched ASAP. Kindle 2 is set to ship next Tuesday and

we would like to announce Kindle 2 availability and Kindle for iPhone at the

meeting, I am happy to bring a beta version of the store-less app any day

any time this week to your offices for you to review if it can help expedite

the final review. Otherwise I'd welcome any of your suggestions on how to

proceed quickly.
