They showed the first demo of this today at Apple's WWDC event.
Two of the most impressive features (human occlusion of CG and live mocap) are powered by tech in the new version of ARKit and were described as "exclusive to iOS".

The AI singularity will probably be some form of ML dick detector.

Totally. We prototyped geo storing of point clouds and fetching a while back (that's the stuff we geeked out on at E3 last year Mark R), using an early version of the RPO galaga stuff. It works reasonably well.
Over time we' ll have to deal with scaling storage of the point cloud, and during gatneplay, density of players, persistence and replicaflon of stuffs that the UE4 server isn't designed for. Sent frotn my iPhone

Ingress and Pokemon Go do placing objects via GPSreasonably well already. I remember having to take photos with GPS enabled to sublnit them to google to make ingress portals, which
are fairly location stable (to the GPS accuracy).

Seelns like ARKit would be at least good enough to do something like "the machines" on iOS and just GPS tag a rough location for which one should appear or not.
Limited to flat surfaces such as roads.

+Ryan explicitly. WMR Spatial anchors in UE4 are in the works, but I' ve not seen thetn running in a hololens, let alone IOS. I can say that the Hololens 2's ability to reliably identify a space that it knows
and provide user-dropped anchors is pretty impressive (locally that is.) it works way better than I was expecting it to. If spatial anchors can reliably replicate that ability to other devices, this could work.

Has anyone tried the spatial anchor thing? Does it really work?

ARKit has a similar feature but it's very hard to use.

Mapping real world places to virtual spaces that can be customized by users is cool though. Ignoring their ad, I think this would be very popular.

Puzzling.

On one hand there are a lot of really cool things I could imagine a world-scale AR Minecraft experience being, on the other none of them are in this nailer. Instead it's just Magic Leap-level overselling of AR capabilities that aren't going to be anywhere close to what they release.

Feels like a sizzle reel for what's going to be a very different experience.
