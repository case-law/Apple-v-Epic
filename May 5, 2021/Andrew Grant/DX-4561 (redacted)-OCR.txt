Business Strategy
· Go al : On Apple and Android mobile devices, publishers allowed to offer 1) third party payment options for apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play 2) seamless third party app store functionality
· Str a tegy: 0 P r o p ose in writing to Apple and Google the goals 0 I f e ither platform is willing, negotiate acceptable timetable for implementation 0 I f e ither platform is unwilling, hotfix option into FN for users to select Epic payment process · Pro p o sed date for hotfix is Thu Aug 13: This isafter13.40 (Aug 4) but before S14 (Aug 27) · Per m a nently adjust pricing across all platforms such that Apple and Google mobile payment platforms are more expensive (other payment platforms pass savings directly to players) 0 I f e ither platform blocks updates after competing payment platforms are added, FN mobile enters "sustainable platform" phase

PR Strategy - Hotfix Update

Goal · Get p l ayers, media, and industry on "Epic's side"

Timeline
· Lau n ch (August TB)D
Strategy · Prov i de clear communications that emphasize savings benefits for players. · Prov i de media with Epic's stance on the business and industry benefits that they can carry forward to their readers; provide them enough background/education on the topic so they can have an informed opinion in discussions.

Plan

Player-facing:direct communication on price changes (blog, social), with emphasis on choice and value. o Ex p l ore opportunity to support with branding
Media-facing:share plans with media (blog), along with a longer media-only note explaining why this is important. o Ta r g eted real-time proactive/pitched follow up interviews with key friendly media outlets in tech, business.
Industry-facing:explore the creation of a coalition that can drive amplify discussion

Challenges · High r isk of leaks limits ability to pre-brief media; proactive can't start until ship · Diff i c ult to convert media/players sympathetic to Apple/Google

Non V-Buckspack RMT price decrease willcause revenue decrease for creators. True in both scenarios

Reduction RamiTications A payment rate decrease could lead to influencer frustration and less support for Fortnite overall and this issue specifically
Requires public messaging change. Current public message:"accepted Creators will receive $5 USD (or the local cunency equivalent) for every 10,000 If-Bucksspent by players"

Maintain Ramifications Creators see no change to affiliate income other than normal volatility they experience from macro Fortnite engagement 8 V-Bucks spending fluctuations
Message to influencers is simple: "this doesn't aFect your earningrates at all, thisis purely a pnce drop for players"'.
Influencer support for Liberty more likely.

GOAL: Migrate POSA to new pricing ASAP NA: position this as a price change in NA and not new SKUs / replace cards with new price ASAP EU: delay initial print run until after new price is public / set up as new SKUs at new pricing
NA Plan
· Onc e public, notify retailers about new price for existing cards · IF P OSA activators are able to modify pricing of existing inventory, time to update in stores would take 2-4 weeks
· Ca rds would sell at new price - but old price would still be on cards
· The re is still strong potential that old inventory could remain on the shelves after transitioning to new cards 0 W e could "turn off' the old cards at some point in the future
EU Plan: Updated launch timing shifts November (someretailers willpushto Q12021) · New Product "certification": 3-4 weeks from time of notification
· Ca rd printing: 6-8 weeks
· Tim e to shelf: 2-4 weeks

o I f it takes retailers longer than 2 weeks to update pricing, consider giving bonus V-Bucks if POSA price was higher
· Co st to transition inventory could exceed $4MM o L arge print runs already in process for back half inventory requirements
o E p ic would need to pay for "merchandising" visits to help with transitioning cards
o E pic would need to reimburse Gearbox for unsold inventory · Re tailers are forecasting their sales based on current pricing
o I d ea: revisit Merry Mint 2.0 as a "make good" and to help drive incremental sales · We h a Ve already COmmitted $536K in MDF fOr Q4 diSplay prOgramS (with cards being printed now/delivered in August)
o So me of these programs are based on current pricing (i.e. $10 pallet program at Kroger)

· New Product "certification": 3-4 weeks from time of notification · Car d printing: 6-8 weeks · Tim e to shelf: 2-4 weeks
Contractual Requirements if POSA activators/retailers consider current SKU's "discontinued product":
