Application contains, uses or supports any such data encryption or cryptographic functionality, You certify that You have complied with the United States Export Administration Regulations, and are in possession of, and will upon request provide Apple with, a PDF copy of Your Encryption Registration Number (ERN), or export classification ruling (CCATS) issued by the United States Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security and PDF copies of appropriate authorizations from other countries that mandate import authorizations for that Licensed Application, as required. You acknowledge that Apple is relying upon Your certification in this Section 2.3 in allowing End-Users to access and download the Licensed Applications under this Schedule 2. Except as provided in this Section 2.3, Apple will be responsible for compliance with the requirements of the Export Administration Regulations in allowing End-Users to access and download the Licensed Applications under this Schedule 2.
2.4 Y o u shall be responsible for determining and implementing any age ratings or parental advisory warnings required by the applicable government regulations, ratings board(s), seivice(s), or other organizations (each a "Ratings Board" ) for any video, television, gaming or other content offered in Your Licensed Application for each locality in the Territory. Where applicable, You shall also be responsible for providing any content restriction tools or age verification functionality before enabling end-users to access mature or otherwise regulated content within Your Licensed Application.
3. Del i very of the Licensed Applications to End-Users
3.1 Y o u acknowledge and agree that Apple, in the course of acting as agent and/or commissionaire for You, is hosting, or pursuant to Section 1.2(b) of this Schedule 2 may enable authorized third parties to host, the Licensed Applications, and is allowing the download of those Licensed Applications by End-users, on Your behalf. However, You are responsible for hosting and delivering content or services sold by You using the InApp Purchase API, except for content that is included within the Licensed Application itself (i.e., the In-App Purchase simply unlocks the content) or content hosted by Apple pursuant to section 3.3 of Attachment 2 to the Agreement. All of the Licensed Applications shall be marketed by Apple, on Your behalf, to End-Users at prices identified in a price tier and designated by You, in Your sole discretion, from the pricing schedule attached to this Schedule 2 as Exhibit C, which may be updated from time to time by Apple on App Store Connect. In addition, You may, at Your election via App Store Connect, instruct Apple to market the Licensed Applications at a discount of 50% of Your established price tier for authorized institutional customers. You may change the price tier for any Licensed Application at any time, at Your discretion, in accordance with the pricing schedule set forth on that Exhibit C as updated from time to time, using tools provided on the App Store Connect tool. As Your agent and/or commissionaire, Apple shall be solely responsible for the collection of all prices payable by End-Users for Licensed Applications acquired by those End-Users under this Schedule 2.
3.2 I n the event that the sale or delivery of any of the Licensed Applications to any End-User is subject to any sales, use, goods and services, value added, or other similar tax or levy, under applicable law, responsibility for the collection and remittance of that tax for sales of the Licensed Applications to End-Users will be determined in accordance with Exhibit B to this Schedule 2 as updated from time to time via the App Store Connect site. For the sake of clarity, Apple shall not be responsible for the collection and remittance of telecommunications and similar taxes. You shall indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.
3.3 I n furtherance of the parties' respective tax compliance obligations, Apple requires that You comply with the requirements listed on Exhibit D to this Schedule 2 or on App Store Connect depending upon, among other things, (i) Your country of residence and (ii) the countries designated by You in which You wish Apple to allow access to the Licensed Applications. In the event that Apple collects any amounts corresponding to the purchase price for any of Your Licensed Applications before You have provided Apple with any tax documentation required under Exhibit D to this Schedule 2, Apple will not remit those amounts to You, but will hold those amounts in trust for You, until such time as You have provided Apple with the required tax documentation. Upon receipt of all required tax documents from You, Apple will remit to You any amounts held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, under this Section 3.3, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 2.
3.4 A p ple shall be entitled to the following commissions in consideration for its services as Your agent and/or commissionaire under this Schedule 2:

commission equal to thirty percent (30%) of all prices payable by each End-User. Solely for auto-renewing subscription purchases made by customers who have accrued greater than one year of paid subscription service within a Subscription Group (as defined below) and notwithstanding any Retention Grace Periods, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to fifteen percent (15%) of all prices payable by each End-User for each subsequent renewal. Retention Grace Period refers to the time period between the end of a customer's subscription (e.g. due to cancelation or non-payment) and the beginning of a new subscription within the same Subscription Group, provided that such time period is no greater than 60 days, subject to change. For purposes of determining the commissions to which Apple is entitled under this Section 3.4(a), the prices payable by End-Users shall be net of any and all taxes collected, as provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2.
(b) For sales of Licensed Applications to End-Users located in those countries listed in Exhibit B, Section 2 of this Schedule 2 as updated from time to time via the App Store Connect site, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to thirty percent (30%) of all prices payable by each End-User. Solely for auto-renewing subscription purchases made by customers who have accrued greater than one year of paid subscription service within a Subscription Group (as defined below) and notwithstanding any Retention Grace Periods, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to fifteen percent (15%) of all prices payable by each End-User for each subsequent renewal.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2, Apple shall be entitled to the commissions specified in Sections 3.4(a) and 3.4(b) hereof without reduction for any taxes or other government levies, including any and all taxes or other, similar obligations of You, Apple or any End-User relating to the delivery or use of the Licensed Applications. For sales of Licensed Applications developed by Apple, Apple is not entitled to a commission.
3.5 U p on collection of any amounts from any End-User as the price for any Licensed Application delivered to that End-User hereunder, Apple shall deduct the full amount of its commission with respect to that Licensed Application, and any taxes collected by Apple under Section 3.2 and 3.4 hereof, and shall remit to You, or issue a credit in Your favor, as the case may be, the remainder of those prices in accordance with Apple standard business practices, including the following: remittance payments (i) are made by means of wire transfer only; (ii) are subject to minimum monthly remittance amount thresholds; (iii) require You to provide certain remittance-related information on the App Store Connect site; and (iv) subject to the foregoing requirements, will be made no later than forty-five (45) days following the close of the monthly period in which the corresponding amount was received by Apple from the End-User. No later than forty- five (45) days following the end of each monthly period, Apple will make available to You on the App Store Connect site a sales report in sufficient detail to permit You to identify the Licensed Applications sold in that monthly period and the total amount to be remitted to You by Apple. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Apple shall be entitled to a commission, in accordance with this Section 3.5 on the delivery of any Licensed Application to any End-user, even if Apple is unable to collect the price for that Licensed Application from that End-User. In the event that the purchase price received by Apple from any End-User for any Licensed Application is in a currency other than the remittance currency agreed between Apple and You, the purchase price for that Licensed Application shall be converted to the remittance currency, and the amount to be remitted by Apple to You shall be determined, in accordance with an exchange rate fixed for the Delivery Period, as reflected in Exhibit C attached hereto as updated from time to time pursuant to section 3.1 of this Schedule 2. Apple may provide a means on App Store Connect to enable You to designate a primary currency for the bank account designated by You for receiving remittances (" Designated Currency" ). Apple may cause Apple's bank to convert all remittances in any remittance currency other than the Designated Currency into the Designated Currency prior to remittance to You. You agree that any resulting currency exchange differentials or fees charged by Apple's bank may be deducted from such remittances. You remain responsible for any fees (e.g., wire transfer fees) charged byYour bank orany intermediary banks between Your bank and Apple's bank.
3.6 I n the event that any price payable by any End-User for any of the Licensed Applications is subject to (i) any withholding or similar tax; or (ii) any sales, use, goods and services, value added, or other tax or levy not collected by Apple under Section 3.2 hereof; or (iii) any other tax or other government levy of whatever nature, the full amount of that tax or levy shall be solely for Your account, and shall not reduce the commission to which Apple is entitled under this Schedule 2.
3.7 I n the event that any remittance made by Apple to You is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the full amount of that withholding or similar tax shall be solely for Your account, and will not reduce the commission to which Apple is entitled on that transaction. If Apple reasonably believes that such tax is due, Apple will deduct the full amount of such withholding or similar tax from the gross amount owed to You, and will pay the full

amount withheld over to the competent tax authorities. Apple will apply a reduced rate of withholding tax, if any, provided for in any applicable income tax treaty only if You furnish Apple with such documentation required under that income tax treaty or otherwise satisfactory to Apple, sufficient to establish Your entitlement to the benefit of that reduced rate of withholding tax. Upon Your timely request to Apple in writing, using means reasonably designated by Apple, Apple will use commercially practical efforts to report to You the amount of Apple's payment of withholding or similar taxes to the competent tax authorities on Your behalf. You will indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority for any underpayment of any such withholding or similar taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by You as to Your entitlement to, or Your disqualification for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax.
3.8 Y o u may offer auto-renewing subscriptions in select Territories using the In-App Purchase API subject to the terms of this Schedule 2, provided that:
(a) Auto-renew functionality must be on a weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, tri-monthly, semi-annual or annual basis at prices You select in the App Store Connect tool. You may offer multiple durations and service levels for Your subscription and will have the ability to associate and rank these subscription items within Subscription Groups, to enable customers to easily upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade amongst the Subscription Group options. You understand and agree that when a subscriber upgrades or crossgrades (except for crossgrades of different durations), such service level will begin immediately and Your proceeds will be adjusted accordingly, and when a subscriber downgrades, the new service will begin at the end of the current subscription period.
(b) You clearly and conspicuously disclose to users the following information regarding Your auto-renewing subscription:
· Title of auto-renewing subscription, which may be the same as the in-app product name · Length of subscription · Price of subscription, and price per unit if appropriate
Links to Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Use must be accessible within Your Licensed Application.
(c) You must fulfill the offer during the entire subscription period, as marketed, including any Billing Grace Period You authorize, and, in the event You breach this section 3.8(c) of Schedule 2, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to refund to the End-User the full amount, or any portion thereof in Apple's sole discretion, of the price paid by the End-User for that subscription. Billing Grace Period refers to the period during which Developers agree to provide paid service for free to users who do not recover from a billing error. In the event that Apple refunds any such price to an End-user, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price for that subscription. Apple will have the right to retain its commission on the sale of that subscription, notwithstanding the refund of the price to the End-User. You acknowledge that Apple may exercise its rights under section 7.3 of this Schedule 2 for repeated violations of this provision.
3.9 W h en You make price changes to an existing subscription item, You may elect to retain current pricing for Your existing customers by indicating Your intent in the App Store Connect tool. When You increase pricing for existing subscribers in countries that require end-user consent, they will be prompted to review and agree to the new price, otherwise the auto-renewal feature will be disabled.
3.10 To the extent You promote and offer for sale auto-renewing subscriptions, within or outside of Your Licensed Application, You must do so in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.
3.11 Subscription services purchased within Licensed Applications must use In-App Purchase.
In addition to using the In-App Purchase API, a Licensed Application may read or play content (magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video) that is offered outside of the Licensed Application (such as, by way of example, through Your website) provided that You do not link to or market external offers for such content within the Licensed Application. You are responsible for authentication access to content acquired outside of the Licensed Application.
3.12 If Your Licensed Application is periodical content-based (e.g. magazines and newspapers), Apple may provide You with the name, email address, and zip code associated with an End-User's account when they purchase an auto-renewing subscription via the In-App Purchase API, provided that such user consents to the

3.13 D e l eted
3.14 Where available, You may offer multiple Licensed Applications offered by You in a single collection (" Bundle" ) to End-Users at a price tier designated by You as set forth in Exhibit C (" Bundle Price" ). Furthermore, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to enable users who have purchased some but not all Licensed Applications in a Bundle to access and download the remaining items in the Bundle (" Complete My Bundle" or "CMB") for the CMB Price. You will receive proceeds for the CMB Price, which shall equal the Bundle Price set by You less the sum of the retail prices paid by the user for previously purchased Licensed Applications. In the event the CMB Price is less than Tier 1 and greater than zero under Exhibit C, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to set the CMB Price for that user at Tier 1. In the event the CMB Price is less than zero, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to provide the remaining Licensed Applications in the Bundle to the End-User without charge. Each CMB transaction will be reflected in Your statement as follows: (i) a new sale of the full Bundle at the price paid for the Bundle, identified as a CMB sale; and (ii) a return (i.e. a negative transaction) for each eligible purchased Licensed Application contained in the Bundle in the amount previously paid for the Licensed Application, each identified as a CMB return. Bundles offered at Tier 0 must offer an auto-renewing subscription service pursuant to Section 3.8 of this Schedule 2 in each Licensed Application included in the Bundle, and users who purchase such subscription service from within one app in the Bundle must be able to access that subscription service in each of the other Licensed Applications in the Bundle at no additional cost.
4. Own e rship and End-User Licensing
4.1 T h e parties acknowledge and agree that Apple shall not acquire any ownership interest in or to any of the Licensed Applications or Licensed Application Information, and title, risk of loss, responsibility for, and control over the Licensed Applications shall, at all times, remain with You.

4.3 Y o u hereby acknowledge that the EULA for each of the Licensed Applications is solely between You and the End-User and conforms to applicable law, and Apple shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by You or any End-User of any of the terms and conditions of any EULA.

5.4 L i c ensed Applications that are targeted at children or otherwise likely to appeal to children, and which pressure children to make purchases (including, but not limited to, phrases such as "buy now" or "upgrade now") or persuade others to make purchases for them, should not be made available in any Territory that has deemed such marketing practices illegal.

You have violated any rules promulgated by Apple. These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.
