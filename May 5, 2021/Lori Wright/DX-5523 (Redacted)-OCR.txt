Executive Summary

Publishers captured the majority of total industry profit (66%); platforms in closed ecosystems/networks (e.g., Console, Mobile, Browser)

segmenpt generated 39-46% Gf

rofits while platfol'ITls In open ecosysteITls (I.e. PC Client) genel'ated only 5% Gf segment proflit

Platforms' relatively low share of PC Client segment profit (5%) reflects revenue flowing directly from consumers to publishers -- 83% of worldwide PC Client revenue

Free-to-Play remains the industry's primary business model (70% of total revenue), is the largest driver of profit (74% of total),,and sees the healthiest profit margins (32%), a function of publishers' ability to invest with demonstrated market success

Tencent" is the largest company in the industry, generating an estimated $19AB in revenue and $6.38 in profit

ln addition to Tencent, 9 other companies generated more than $18 in profit' from so~are R services including Apple ($528), Sony ($4.18),

Following a standout year in CY2018, Fortnite revenue declined by one-third; the title remained a standout performer across multiple segments · Epic acquired Psyonix and its Rocket Leogue (RL) IP in May 2019 to diversify its 1P content portfolio
In January 2019, Epic launched the Epic Games Store on PC; given the company's public commitment to a 12% platform fee, we believe the store makes a minimal financial contribution to Epic's overall business
