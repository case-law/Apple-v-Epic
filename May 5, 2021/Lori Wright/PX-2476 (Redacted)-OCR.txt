SALES RESULTS
Sony avIvIaunced that the garne had sold through more than 4 million copies as of 3uvIe 21, the first week of the garne's release.

he Last of Us Part 0, like its predecessor, is first and foremast a nan ativeadventure game. Thisisunlike Naughty Dog's other key franchise UrIchovted, where the narrative, while very well told, is there move to service the action; adventure gameplay.
While there is plenty of stealth action garneplay isn 7he Lest of Us Part N, the game s
primarypurpose iIs to Immerse the player irI the interactIve narrative. The game pushes
this idea even further than Its predecessor by incorporating a number of extended "walking sirnulatar" style narrative chapters. These play out much like the first game's stand-alone expansion chapter Left BehivId. While these rrIay not be what many garrIers ar e expecting, they are exceptionally well dorIe and really show what other games, especially pure rIarratiIve adverIture games, should be aspirIrIg to accampliIsh wirth theiIr character dialogue, presentation and voice acting.
ln order to achIeve the detail and belIevabiIlity of the character irIteI actIarI arId dIalogue in the game Naughty Dag has made a clear choIce to sacnfice much of the player's agency in the story in favor of fixed outcames in order to achieve the highest production values. That the player doesn't have the ability to greatly influence ar determine the outcome of the narrative might prove anathema to many players and how they view their voie in the video game experience. However, we would argue that not every video game must be about the player raleplaying their characteI's story. I he medium of interactive entertainment also needs games that drive stories where you are participating mare in the capacity af an active "observer," just like other mediums of entertainment, otherwise we' re going ta be locked inta a limited number af stoviesto tell.
The garvIe s narrative attempts to teII an emotionally relevant story of revenge arId its
moral arId ernotIarIal impacton the lives of the people irIvolved, whiIle at the same time
tryIng to create a consistently engagIng InteractIve expelI'Ience. The playeI proceeds through two separate, fully realized carnpaIgns; one as Ellie, and another completely differerIt carvIpaIgn as Abby -- the woman Ellie has sworn to kill. Qther games that have tried this in the past have stumbled by nat lettiIng players play as the "hero characters" they caer about. But TiIe Lost of Usfranchisedoesn't reallyhave "heroes", justsurvivors. Both Ellie and Abby aI e well I ea lazed arId relatable characters and playirIg thraugh both of their stories does a tremendous job af showing haw otherwise decent people can became trapped in a vicious cycle af harr y ing violence.
The garvIeplay In The Lost of Us Port 0 isan exparIsIarI and natable I mprovementupon
the previous game, which gave players little freedom af choIce in the moment-tomornent gameplay. Mast levels isn the first garvIe played out like liIttle *"corrIbat puzzle

boxes" where there was a navraw predetermined "right way" ta finish the missian, which made the effective strategy feel farced upon you. In this new game the cavvIbat areas are significantly laager, the enemy Al gireatly improved, and the rIumber af ways yau can clear a space (av just avaid it altogether ) are greatly enhanced. That said, Naughty Dog still can't seem to make decent gun combat in ~an af their games, and this one is no exception. Luckily for them it fits in with the garne's overall theme and pushes the player taward using stealth aver head-on.
Qne big gripe about the moment-to-moment gameplay was really with the game's inventory system. The inputs for weapon switching ave all lacated an the d-pad, and there was no "quick switch" between current and previous weapons. So unless you' ve gat an additional thumb on your left hand, then you' re going to have ta take your thumb off the Inovement controls on the left stiIck In avder ta switch weapons, which was notably frustrating during the more fvenetic combat sequences.
The visual quality and attention to detail in The Lost of Us Port ii is absolutely best-inclass In basically every area, and the averall pr eserItatiarI is signilficarItly ahead of anytlllIng that other teams lllave been pIoducIng on console and PC. We weve frequently stunned by the quality of the game's visuals, something that sadly seldom happens these days. It s even more impressive considering that the game feature two separate player characters wiIth diIfferent groups af alliIes, in different locations, alarIg with flashback sequences taking place years before. It features a shockingly wide varIety af envII onments, weather, arId day cycles In lacations vangiing fvorrI wyoming ta calIfarrIia.
playevs certairIly have every right to their subjective feelirIgs and opinions on the game's narrative, on Naughty Dog's choIce to make players play as diIarnetIically oppased pvotagonIsts, or in the game s final contentious outcome. But as someone who cares deeply about the evolution and expansion of what storytelling in interactive entertainment CAN BE, those things ultimately matter less than how incredibly well Naughty Dag have crafted arId delivered the story that THEY wanted to tell. Not every game's designs can support the level of visual detail they praduce, and nat every team has the money ortalent needed to produce it,butthisgame sets a new bar for w hat we should hope ta be able to achieve going into a new generatIon af consoles.
The Lost of Us Part 0 isthe exceedingly rare video game where what it accomplishes in moving forward the art of narrative storytelling in video games as a medium ultimately autweighs whether ar not everyone "likes" It ar even if everyone has "fun" playing it. That saId we loved it, had a great time playirIg it, and fInd ouIselves still thinking about its characters and stories even after finishing the playthrough.
