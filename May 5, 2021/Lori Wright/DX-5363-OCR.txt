Drivers

Key Points

· WW video game market will grow at a 10.5% CAGR from $51 B in 2009 to $84B in 2014 · Online game segment will grow from $11.7B in 2009 to $30.6B in 2014, a CAGR of
21.3%, driven by growth in APAC · Wireless game segment will grow from $7.3B in 2009 to $13.1B in 2014, a CAGR of
12.3% · PC Games is the only declining segment

· Traditional physical retailers are expanding their digital presence in games · All major competitors have digital offerings · Competitors typically price digital games at a lower price point than physical games · All digital retail websites focus on targeting the core gamer · New competitors are on emerging gaming platforms such as mobile devices, social
networks and cloud services
· Fast improving technology on mobile phones make it a strong alternative to consoles
for non-core garners
· Developer community on emerging platforms is fast growing resulting in an abundance of games on these platforms
· Downward pressure on price is driven by freemium and ad-based games available on mobile and social platforms
· The Wii, Move, and Kinect coupled with social game publishers developing games for consoles, drives more non-core garners to consoles than ever before
· New revenue models are being explored on mobile and social platforms that compete for gaming mind and wallet share

Key Implications to XBLM
· Online and wireless games present strong growth opportunities where XBLM can leverage areas of Microsoft's broader portfolio
· A key point of differentiation is required to carve a unique value proposition for XBLM users
· Segmentation is becoming more important with the growth ofnon-core garners on XBLM who are more
price sensitive than core garners
· There is a need for a strong developer value proposition for games on XBLM to counter developer focus on mobile and social games, and also maintain depth and breadth of games that appeal to XBLM's newer customer segments
· Low priced and free online social games and wireless games challenge traditional gaming price models
· Pricing schemes should be evaluated to combat popular, emerging revenue models being employed on competing gaming platform marketplaces

Key Points · Publishers heavily rely on pre-established brands, in the form of sequels and licensed intellectual properties, to maximize the predictability of their
investments in development and marketing · Benefits include:higher likelihood of market acceptance, iteration breeds perfection, re-usable assets · Drawbacks include:few new brands and IP are developed, buyers feel comfortable skipping a title that may not have significant new content (especially sports titles)

Drivers of Lower Development Costs on Social and Mobile Platforms · Smaller scope of games -- limited gameplay requirements and expectation for games on social and mobile platforms · Reduced graphical complexity -- screen size and type of engagement do not warrant excessive investment in graphics (e.g. 2D games suffice
on mobile, while consoles push for 3D content) · Lower pricing -- developers limit time and capital spent because of lower price point of games

· Most of these publishers employ the "Paid Applications at a Low Price" model, although several titles (with Capcom as apparent leader) focused on an "Advertising" model

· These large publishers did not leverage the "In Game Purchases" model to a significant extent, in contrast to mobile-focused developers such as Zynga

Implications of trends to XBLM.
· Cheaper, more powerful technology on non-console devices provide more gaming options for consumers, which reduces the use of XBLM as an entry point to gaming
· Developer and publisher focus ensures breadth of games available on new platforms providing consumers with greater game options outside XBLM
· Growth of the non-core gamer segment on XBLM shifts average gaming preference from AAA type games to other type of games
· Downward pressure on pricing for games on emerging platforms threatens the value of undifferentiated games on XBLM as consumers associate certain game types with lower prices
· Increased price sensitivity for subscriptions, and shift of gaming spend to virtual goods challenges XBLMs current subscription model pricing

· GameStop enjoys "a monopolistic loyalty base among the under 25 crowd", which gives them pricing power to maintain premium pricing
· GameStop stores are a destination for game buyers because:
· Knowledgeable and enthusiastic sales associates make the store a destination for core garnerswanting to discussgames
· Sales associates provide recommendations to non-core garners
seeking assistance with their game purchase
· Gaming on demand and windowing will change positioning of retailers in physical games

Key Points · Major streaming vendors, publishers and gaming console manufacturers are marketing their products to the mature gamer; they feature
a large selection of "mature" games and website presentation is geared towards an older audience
· Premium-priced games are typically played and purchased by the "mature" core gamer
· Mobile and social companies target casual garners with games for all ages · EA's casual gaming site, Pogo, has a very different marketing spin than its main EA Store site
· Companies try to maintain a premium experience for their mature core gamer

Implications of marketplace competition to XBLM.
· Competing marketplaces are focused on or shifting focus to digital games, and they are trying to find ways to differentiate
· The many digital marketplaces provide consumers with more places to buy games, which could chip away at XBLM's market share
· Most marketplace share the same focus on the core gamer segment · Core gamer focused marketplaces have yet to figure out how to monetize the growing casual
gamer segment in a meaningful way
· The marketplace that figures out how to successfully migrate casual garnersto more of a core
gamer type spending and behavior will reap rewards
