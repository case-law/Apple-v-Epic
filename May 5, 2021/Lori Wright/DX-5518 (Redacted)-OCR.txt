Principles for the Microsoft Store on Windows
Public statement from President CELA
For software developers,,app stores have tiecome a critical gatewayto some af the world's most papular digital platforms. We
and others have raised questions and,,at times,,expressed concerns about app stores on other digitall platformsHowever, we
recognize that we should practice what we preach. Sa, today, we are adapting 10 priinciples -- building on the ideas and work af the Coalition for A F a irness CAF -- to promote choice, ensure fairness and promote innovation ar Windows 10, our most popular platform, and our own Microsoft Store an Windows 10:
1. Developers willi have the freedom to choose whether to distribute their apps for Windows through our app store. We willi not block competing app stores on Windows.
2. We willi not block an app from Windows based on a developer's business modell or how it dellivers content and services,, includimg wtiether content is installed on a device ar streamed from the cloud.
3. We willi not block an app from Wiindows based on a developer's choice of which payment system ta use for pracessing purchases made iin its app.

For Discussion

S. Every develaper will have access to aur app store as lang as it meets objective standards and requirements, including these for security privacy, quality, centare and digital safety E. Our app store wtlll charge reasonable feesthatrefiect the competrtion we face from other app stores an Windows and vnli not force a developer to sell within its app anything it
daesn't ivant to sell. 7. Our app stare willi not prevent developers fronn connnnunicating dtrertly with their users through their apps for llegitimate business purposes. g. Ourappstarewillholdourawnappstathesamestandardstowhichithaldscampetingapps S. Miicrosoft willi not use ariynon publlic iinfarmation or data freon its app store aboirt a devetoper's appto connpete with it. 10. Our app store will be transparent abaut its rules and poliicies and opportunitiies tar promotion and marketiing,,apply these consistently and objectively,,provide notice at changes and
make avaliablle a fair process to resolve disputes.

*the ADA also addresses the Windows 8 legacy platform as welt as Stare for Business and Education When we madethe update to reduce Microsoft rev share for apps from
80% to 'l5% there were technical constraints preventing us tram updating the rev share model for transactions on those platforms/Storefronts, hence the carve out in the ADA. Tttese platforms account fora very small percentage of transactions and the SFB/EDU is going to deprecate its commerce functionality by the end of C)t CY 2021
