Assignment
и Consider using a survey to elicit reactions of U.S. consumers to a
five-percent increase in the price of in-app purchases and subscriptions on iQS apps (" at-issue purchases"). и 1 concluded that this would be feasible based on the long tradition of using surveys to assess hypotheticals. My challenge was to implement such a survey with a high degree of reliability.
