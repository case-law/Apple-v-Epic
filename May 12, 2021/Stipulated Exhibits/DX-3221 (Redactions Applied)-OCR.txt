THIS DECK ISDESIGNED TO BE CONSUMED WITH THE SPEAKER NOTES.
Most Googlers' understanding of Android in China (AiC) are limited to the phrase "it' s complicated", but when you ask them to explain HOW it is complicated I different from rest of world (RoW), they draw a blank.

Our goal in this presentation is to give you a sufficiently deep understanding of how Android in China (AiC) actually works, and how it is different from RoVV; just getting
an understanding of where things are.
The goa! of this presentation is NOT to present solutions to the problems described
here (that would be for a different presa).

If you have not already, I highly recommend signing up for the guided tour at the China Experience Lab (go/celab) in 844. It provides a fantastic consumer experience of AiC,,and would give you more insight into how the dynamics described in this deck end up affecting Chinese Android users.

In Googie, we hardly ever think about a world where Play is not Android's distribution mechanism and policy enforcer. VVe design and build Android where Play's existence is somewhat assumed.
The problem with is.... this is simply not. true for a HUGE percentage of mobile users.
Using revenue as a proxy for usage, AiC is about just as big as Android on Play.

GOOG-APPL-00100251

In case you didn't know already, China is: The most populous country on Earth Roughly the same physica! size as the US Lots of users with lots of devices on very fast networks.
If you' ve been to China as a tourist, you might think that the network is slow. That is almost certainly only because you were trying to access services that are throttled (or outright blocked) by the firewall. Connectivity to local services are all just as fast as you would expect in a developed country.
By the way..... "China' * in this context means '*mainland China", and explicitly excludes Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.

A (vasily) simplified picture of the Aic ecosystem looks somewhat like this. li is mainly made up of 2 camps who have an outsized influence on the ecosystem: ihe biggest app developers ("3P Whales" ) like Tencent, Alibaba,,Baidu ihe Android GEMs like Xiaomi and Huawei
There are obviously other players like carriers and long tail developers, but we' ll leave them out for now for simplicity.
(Google services are on the outside looking in).

whales) naturaily havecorn etin interests.

GEMs and 3P devs naturally have competing interests. GEMs want to sell more devices and/or sell more users onto services proprietary to said device, while 3P apps want more reach across many different devices.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.020

GOOG-APPL-00100256

Outside of China, Google Services (specifically - GMSCore, Play store, and FCM) together therefore play an important function in putting the right incentives in place in making sure those 2 forces are held in tension without. breaking. l3evs by-and-large only worry about 3 distribution and update channel, 1 main reengagement mechanism, and i consistent way in which policies are enforced.
Incidentally, this also puts Google in a powerful position in the ecosystem.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.021

GOOG-APPL-00100257

The fact that these critical services do not exist in China means the loss of a de-facto arbitrator, and that incentives that are placed in the ecosystem are not necessarily aligned.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.022

GOOG-APPL-00100258

renQe ntr:8.''sa
Google Services not being in China is just a power vacuum begging to be filled. 3P devs and OEMs all rush in to fill it, and then they one-up each other to get into the best position possible.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.023

GOOG-APPL-00100259

Case in point 1: All major app stores are backed by either a 3P whale or an GEM.
GEMs wield great power in favoring their own stores; while 3P stores, without the power of pre-installation and system defaults, pile on features and turn up the notification dial to try to get users to re-engage.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.024

GOOG-APPL-00100260

Case in point 2: push notification service! Again, all major push notification services are either a 3P push service or an GEM push service.
Everybody wants to be the arbitrator of push service. GEMs have the distinct advantage of also controlling how/whether such notifications actually get through to their own device, and so wield great power in getting devs to fall in-line.

And devs end up having to handling multiple everythingDifferent stores have different policies and requirements for store listing artifacts Some push services are more effective on some devices than others Stores scrape other stores for APKs, so a dev's app might end up on another store Etc.
A dev has to find other ways, even sub-optimal ones,, to work around this cross-fire.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.027

GOOG-APPL-00100263

Sub-optimal ways by developers include: Using Webviews for major parts of the app Using app protection techniques (sometimes also called "obfuscation", but in China this term means a lot more than just using Proguard) to protect apps from being unpacked / decompiled then modified / repacked and uploaded to all app markets Dynamically loading code so that apps reduce reliance on stores Using the superpowers of Accessibility service to take things into their own hands
These are all considered anti-patterns in RoVV, but in China these are necessities. All 4 of these sub-optimal ways are used outside of China as well, but the extent to which it happens is way higher in CN than in RoW.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.031

GOOG-APPL-00100267

And this is the big one .... As both the 3P whales and the GEMs get bigger and sell more devices internationally, the issues that are typical in China also start showing up in international markets.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.032

GOOG-APPL-00100268

OK,,on to the details. Let's start with this - How do Android apps get distributed in China'7
As you' ll see, the problemhere is that each developer has to contend with many,
many stores.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.033

GOOG-APPL-00100269

Outside of China, we know the mechanism through which apps end up on users' devices - it's the Play Store. The Play store exerts a tremendous amount of control - how apps are distributed, how they are updated, how policy is enforced, etc.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.034

GOOG-APPL-00100270

In China, the Play store does not exist, so there is an obvious power vacuum.. So who fills this gap7

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.035

GOOG-APPL-00100271

You might have heard that there are many Android app stores in China.... and that is 'tl ue. By and large,, these app stores play the role of app distribution and app updates, just like you would expect.
The app store fragmentation is not THAT crazy though; despite there being hundreds to more than a thousand stores, consolidation is happening, and there are "only" -20 that really have meaningful scale.
Now, nobody likes missing out. Every China app store obviously wants the richest app catalog possible....

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.036

GOOG-APPL-00100272

g @ p; AAQj 'U gf @
But you can already see the first problem - a developer is going to have a hard time keeping up with so many stores (even if they only care about the top 20). In this example, just comparing 2 of the stores (Huawei store and Tencent store) and you can immediately see that screenshot requirements are a little different.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.037

GOOG-APPL-00100273

And of course, different stores have differences in their listing images, descriptions, app review timeframes, SDKs allowed (and not allowed), etc......
So if you' re a top-10 store, developers might (and it's still only a "might") put in the work to publish to your store.
lf you' re in the iong tail, then good luck with developers organically publishing there.
So how do stores try to keep the fullest catalog possible' ?

GOOG-APPL-00100275

Answer: Stores often scrape other stores for apps (and app updates).
They do so by comparing the version code of an app store with what they currently have in their own store; if what they have is of an older version, they will grab the newer version'ed app and host that instead.
As an app developer, this means that once you publish a newer version of your app to a store, you lose a lot of control over how / where users actuaiiy get that app from...

GOOG-APPL-00100276

... and it's obviously not really possible to then fully recall the app update if it turns out there are critical bugs. The app developer can push out further app updates to fix, but it's anyone's guess if that update will make its way to the end user.

Devs vesPOAd bg:
Now how do Aic devs mitigate this multi-store situation, where stores are out there scraping apps'7 There are a few ways.... Let's walk through that one by one.

Almost every major app out there maintains a website with their APK download link, which is their way of saying what their "source of truth" is. (This example screenshot shows UC Browser's website,,but. the same goes for every other major app).
VVebsite downloads typically do not drive a ton of traffic by themselves; however, app stores are known to also monitor these websites for updates.

GOOG-APPL-00100280

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.045

GOOG-APPL-00100281

And most app stores provide a way for devs to claim an existing listing (e.g. if the store has previously scraped your APK from somewhere else) as your own.
lt's fairly straightforward - they give you an empty APK, you sign it, and then upload it back to the store along with some proof of your ll3. In a few days, the listing is officially yours. (The UX flow shown here is for Huawei store, but most other stores are also fairly similar).
There are anecdotes of some stores asking the dev for really weird proof, like providing 20 lines of their source code.

GOOG-APPL-00100283

Because Play does not scrape other stores, a developer building for both CN and RoVV (i.e. a "hybrid developer" ) needs to make sure they get their version ordering correct. Specifically, developers have to publish to Play last, otherwise the APK will end up on Chinese stores.
Version ordering matters here especially if the developer has a feature that is just for non-CN users.
True story -- VVeChat launched a feature in -early 20'i 7 called "VVeChat Out", which is a way for non-CN users to pay to call a phone number (similar to Google Voice). VVhen VVeChat launched this, they messed up their version ordering...... and this feature began showing up on CN users' phones.

fee.

All this complexity means that some devs prefer to just let someone else, or something else, handle it.
3P tools like Kuchuan has seen rather rapid adoption. In 2014 (2 years after launch), they: had -50K developers on the platform, claim to make up 50% of all app uploads in Aic. l3evs upload the APK (or APKs, if some stores require specifically customized ones), pick the stores that they want to publish to (30+ stores are available), fili in customization metadata per store, optionally select meta-data tags to edit in the manifest(e.g. different analytics tag for each store), and they' ll sign i modify / publish on your behalf.
Other services like AppPark (http: //www.apppark.cni) offer app publishing services for developers who want to outsource this complexity.

And stores are largely run as ads businesses, instead of just as a merchandising hub as we think about it in Play. There are many spots in stores that devs can pay for for prime placement. Typical paid spots (by keyword auction) include: Splash screen on launch Front page -- top carousel Category pages - top carousels 3 out of 4 (or 5) search results
Some (e.g. Xiaomi) might sometimes denote these as ads,,but many do not.
This is NOT possible on Play (not without a clear note that. something is an Ad); AiC developers are typically shocked when they hear that Play does not really offer such a thing (and vice versa for non-AiC developers when they hear about AiC).

In Play, BD relationships with developers do not involve money changing hands, and do not involve the Play Store doing special customizations.
ln China stores, pretty much anything goes - stores showing push notifications to users for certain apps, faster review times, customized themes for an app listing, etc. Many of these would be unthinkable on Play.
Stores (and 3P webpages) also explicitly list app store contacts for developers to reach out. Check out the long list of contacts here and here that someone can call if they want to talk to a BD person from the app store.

For all the work that developers do to get their app onto different stores, on many stores they often do not get as favorable share of rev split as they do on Play (or iGS app store). lt used to be a 30:70 split (devs get only 30%(!!)) pretty much across all Aic app stores, but since then the trend has moved towards giving devs a more favorable split, though as you can see from the table above in many cases it's still trailing Play.
(As a reminder: Gn Play, the developer: store split for lAP is 70:30)

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.059

GOOG-APPL-00100295

The first is just through organic / paid means. VVe don't frequently hear of 3P app stores buying Google search traffic (through ads)
to market themselves, primarily because of Play's dominance. This practice is SUPER CGMMGN in China, where they are all fighting for users.

This is an example from Tencent store.
A developer can generate a "quick install script" from Tencent app store, which they then host on their desktop website as a button as a CTA for users to click on and download. Clicking it will install the Tencent app store desktop client onto the user's machine, which now manages the user's app installation onto their mobile device.
In addition, this also triggers the installation of the mobile app store onto the user's device, which grows the store's user footprint.

This is an exaggerated view of what you might see on a user's phone - i.e. multiple stores on one phone. GEM stores (e.g. Huawei store) are pre-installed (on a Huawei phone), and the user may also download and install other 3P stores. The key dynamic here is that... and the GEM wields A LGT of power (by virtue of being the device manufacturer) to favor its own store, while 3P stores think of various ways to grab a piece of the user engagement pie. The next logical question is.... How is user experience affected by this'7

3P stores try to constantly use notifications, or set persistent notifications, in an attempt to get the users to engage.
GEMs obviously hate this (after all, they don't want these stores running foreground services and flooding the precious real estate on the notification panel), so they might actively block such notifications.

GOOG-APPL-00100304

Here's a screenshof. of what your phone would look like affer you download a few 3P stores.
Each one of them (in this case, Baidu store, Tencent store, and 360 store) maintains its own persistent notification, and they also consistently monitor the app versions on device and matches that to see if they have a newer version in their catalog. lf they do, if. is a mad rush towards prompting the user to "zomg click me to updafel"

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.069

GOOG-APPL-00100305

GEMs obviously try to limit this.
As an example, this Huawei phone has a special device setting called "filter unimportant notifications" that is turned on by default. (AFAIK this is unrelated to Android framework's notification priorities). VVhen turned on, the GEM might actively hide notifications which it deems spammy, including some of the app store notifications.

3P stores, lacking the power of pre-installation, resort to adding in as many features as they can in an effort to prove their value to users.
GEM stores, on the other hand, want their pre-installed GEM stores to get said user engagement, and so they insert themselves in critical user journeys for app installs.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.071

In a bid for increase user engagement, 3P stores are really not just stores anymore.,,
they all aspire to be super-apps that do EVERYTHING for users - manage
connectivity, kills background processes, manage downloads, cross-sells other apps that purport to help save battery, etc.
Stores become one part of a greater super-app strategy that: Replicates system Ul functionality, Claims to be the guardian of user's device health, Cross-sells other apps, etc.
These added functionality are typically shown in the persistent notifications that these 3P stores show.

Meanwhile,,OEM stores try to get users to use their store instead to install apps,,often times without the user knowing.
Take this example: A user (on their Huawei phone) searches fora music app in Tencent store, and attempts to install the QQ Music app. Huawei device's OS throws up a big scary "app is not safe warning". TBF, this is comparable to "3P sources" warning in typical Android OS; what is different is that the most conspicuous button is one that says "Official Recommendation" and that leads the user to the Huawei store instead. The actual APK install path is just a tiny checkbox.

GOOG-APPL-00100309

GEMs, being the ultimate power broker on a device, often makes it very difficult for 3P stores to install apps.
3P stores fight back by using Android APls that grant superpowers (i.e. Accessibility APl) to bypass some Qf these Iestr'Ictlons.

GOOG-APPL-00100310

OEMs treat 3P app installs like all other unsafe APK installs, and throw up big scary signs all along the critical user journey. Installing app from: 3P store -5 clicks (!) OEM store - i click
To be fair, this is comparable to the "3P sources" warning in typical Android OS; the result is a HUGE difference in number of clicks

GOOG-APPL-00100311

The Accessibility Service API in Android is the great equalizer (sort of) - once a user grants Accessibility Service privs to an app/service, it has the ability to do pretty much anything.
3P stores try to get around the install barriers put up by OEMs by prompting the user to enable Accessibility Service (this usually being sold as a feature called "quick install" or "easy install" ); once a user has enabled Accessibility, the store will automatically click through any dialog popups and prompts thrown up by the OEM.

We have mostly only talked about OEM app stores and 3P app store so far, because they are the biggest players in the app store world. However, let's not forget about the (smaller) carrier app stores.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.078

GOOG-APPL-00100314

Disclaimer: Data about carrier stores and their size tend to be quite old (circa 2013-14), so it' s difficult to teil where they stand today in terms of market size, except to say they they are probably smaller than GEMs and 3P whales.
That said, carrier stores do have unique (and obvious) advantages to them - they are well-funded, and typically use bandwidth savings / credits as a hook to get users to engage with the store. Downloads without incurring bandwidth costs, and promotions within carrier app stores in exchange for bandwidth credits, are all pretty common.

How so'7

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.080

GOOG-APPL-00100316

The easiest way that apps can take things into their own hands is... to distribute their
own appthemselves! Take for example, e-commerce giant Taobao (owned by Alibaba).
ln this series of screenshots, when the user opens the app, Taobao does the following: Prompt the user to update (in this example - "big sale upcoming!"). User shows intent to update by clicking through the dialog prompt.... Downloads the APK, then prompts the user to click install... which begins the sideloading of the app. ... which brings them to the OS' untrusted install warning screens.
Not perfect as QEMs are still in the critical user journey, but at least now the app has more control of its UX.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.081

GOOG-APPL-00100317

The other way is.... to just dynamically hot-patch their binary! Dynamic Code Loading (DCL) is SUPER COMMON for AiC devs and apps.
ln fact, it is so common that all the 3P whales in the ecosystem (Tencent, Alibaba, Didi, etc.) have developed and open-sourced their own DCL frameworks.
imagine the furor that would have been generated if Facebook and Amazon each announces that developers can now use their SDKs to dynamically load code to circumvent stores and OEMs; that's pretty much what has happened in China.
VVe won't go into the details of how DCL is done in this preso; see this doc fora deeper analysis into various DCL techniques in Android overall, and here for DCL in China specifically.

WebS It p.

Viewed from this lens, it is no wonder why WebViews are SUPER PGPULAR in China apps.
l couldn't find any official statistics, but open basically any well-known app in China, and you' ll see what you see in this slide (using food ordering giant Eie.me and ecommerce giant TMall as 2 examples) - major parts of the app are built with WebViews. i could have made 20 more slides showing exactly this with every major app out there.
Gn Play, this is enforced centrally - use of WebViews is heavily discouraged, and apps which rely a ton on WebViews for their main content will never have a chance of getting merchandising featuring on Play. Without such central enforcement, apps quickly fallback to the fastest+ cheapest option to roll out updates -- i.e. WebViews.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.083

GOOG-APPL-00100319

WebView's importance in China cannot be understated, and so updatability of WebViews becomes critical for bug fixes, security patches, etc. Outside of China, the system WebView's gradual progress towards (in Lollipop) being updatable through the Play Store and then (in Nougat) being tied to Chrome's updates works because we can easily distribute updates (thru Play and Chrome). But in China, there is no Play, so System WebView updates are still tied to super slow OS updates. (Example: 360 put up a bulletin asking users to manually update their WebView in the 360 store after a bug surfaced with their OS update rollout).
Google also stopped supporting webviews prior to 4.4: "If the affected version tof WebView] is before 4.4, we generally do not develop the patches ourselves, but welcome patches with the report for consideration. Other than notifying OEMs, we will not be able to take action on any report that is affecting versions before 4.4 that are not accompanied with a patch."
UC claims that, as of Jan 2017, 40'/o of their users are still on Android 4.0-4.4. This means that Android System Webview, as-is, is inadequate for China.

Others rush to fill the void. The major 3P whales (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) all provide their own popular alternatives to the system webviews that 3P apps can use (X5 for Tencent,,U4 for UC, T7 for Baidu). l3evelopers include this 3P VVebView Sl3K into their app for the benefits that come with app compatibility.
Since these 3P whalesalso own and investin many apps, these apps also end up using one ofthese 3P VVebViews.

The many app stores, and misaligned incentives between GEMs / their stores and other 3P stores, is just one problem.
Gnce an app gets onto a device, a 2nd form of incentive misalignment occurs - that between app developersand GEMs.
An app is always trying to stay awake as much as it can, while GEMs are always trying to keep apps asleep as much as possible.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.087

GOOG-APPL-00100323

We' ve already seen how 3P app stores include shortcuts to kill long-running app processes. There are many, many cleaner apps that do the same thing, all in the name of speeding up the device and/or saving battery. Many of them use System Ul settings to add floating screen widgets to let the user quickly get to to it, and then use Accessibility APl to automate the clicking through of various screens to force stop apps ands services.
And judging by how popular cleaner apps are (-550M users), this problem is real in users' minds.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.088

GOOG-APPL-00100324

This fight between apps and the OS is nothing new even outside of China - this is the motivation behind the power saving enhancements introduced in the framework throughout the various Android versions starting from Lollipop onwards.
(Android P further drives that home with App Standby buckets, Battery Saver Mode, and Background Restrictions).

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.089

GOOG-APPL-00100325

In particular, l3oze introduced in Marshmallow is explicit in giving the GS the ability to kill apps, while also giving apps the ability to circumvent that with FCM high priority messages.
Essentially, FCM resolves this tension between developers and GEMs by putting the right incentives into the ecosystem.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.090

GOOG-APPL-00100326

This is further buttressed by the presence of the Play store ~ Play store policy helps ensure that things that things which are allowed in the framework (e.g. apps asking for Battery optimizations whitelisting) can still be disallowed through policy enforcement.
Gutside of China, this combination has two super important properties that means devs can relyon itto wake up as needed: FCM (more generally, Play Services) is on essentially all devices FCM (more generally, Play Services) is whitelisted for Battery Gptimization excep'tlons

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.091

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.092

Unsurprisingly, there are many push service providers that try to fill the gap here.
They can broadly be grouped under 3 buckets: OEM push service 3P push service Aggregators
Let's walk through their characteristics....
https://~ .j i a n s hu.corn/p/05760efb5b07

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.093

Starting with OEM Push Service.... The Xiaomi Push / Huawei Push / etc..

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.094

GOOG-APPL-00100330

GEMs typically all have their own push services that are tightly aligned with the interests of its own devices (rather than with the Android ecosystem as a whole). Devices also aggressively kill services running on devices, so for a msg to get through you really NEED to use the GEM's push service.
E.g. The Huawei Push Service is whitelisted by Huawei on Huawei phones, so messages sentwith that service will get through to a Huawei phone.
This model is very similar to FCM + Doze mode, just working on subset of Android devices rather than across the entire ecosystem.
For developers, the trade-off is clear: if you want your push msg to make it to a Huawei device, use the Huawei Push SDK. All bets are off if you use any other push service. But,, there are so many GEMs in market, and l can't possibly integrate with (and maintain) them all.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.095

GOOG-APPL-00100331

And then there are the 3P push service providers, which typically (but not always) are provided by the 3P whales (e.g. Tencent, Alibaba, etc.).
They do not have the advantage of OEM whitelist, and so need to use other tricks to maximize their delivery rates.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.096

GOOG-APPL-00100332

There are lots of tricks that 3P push services employ to try to keep themselves awake. The most obvious one is just .... Maintaining a long running service.
A more interesting phenom is called "chain starting" ("f54~'RZh"), or more informally k nown as "family bucket" ("NI Q " ) .

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.097

GOOG-APPL-00100333

A more interesting phenom is called "chain starting" ("kif A~P Zh"), or more informally known as "family bucket" ("NN8").
VVhen an app withthe 3P push SDK is launched, the app might send a broadcast intent that would attempt to wake up other apps that are using the same SDK. There is a bit of a network effect going on here.... The more popular the 3P push SDK, the more likely there will be apps on-device that can then wake up other apps (hence the name chain-starting).
(BTVV, here is an unfortunately-named github project which a dev can use to wrap their Context objects to prevent chain starting)

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.098

GOOG-APPL-00100334

From an GEM's perspective, chain starting is obviously a problem as it negates GEMs' efforts to save battery on their phones.
So they start to fight backSorne GEMs like Xiaomi are known to be particularly aggressive towards disallowing this behavior by implementing a heavy-handed version of Doze. For example, in the latest MlUl 8, unnecessary "chain starts" are no longer allowed (user can turn this feature on in settings). This was headlined (on their homepage) as their main battery saving feature.
This goes way beyond anything that Doze is doing currently so far.

GOOG-APPL-00100336

And lastly, the push aggregators - these really function as convenience wrapper SDKs that try to reduce the complexity for developers building, e.g. by switching between GEM push services providers and 3P push services under (ideally) 'i SDK.
Not the easiest though... e.g. for U-Push, developers still have to go sign up for various GEMs service keys in their console, then add the SDK and relevant configuration metadata into the U-Push SDK in the project. XKCD summarizes the risk pretty well.
Ultimately, whoever holds the whitelist holds the power ..... and GEMs hold the whitelist.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221. 1 01

GOOG-APPL-00100337

And this is the big one .... As these GEMs get bigger and sell more devices internationally, the issues that are typical in China also start showing up in international markets.
Apps on Play obviously will be using FCM (and not Huawei Push or Xiaomi Push) to send messages, but if the GEMs do not conduct compatibility testing to the fullest on the international SKUs of these GEM's devices before they ship,,serious problems will arise. What was once a problem in China will have spilled out into the international scene as well. Examples: Gverall: http: //b/30760529 Huawei: http: //b/30945093 Xiaomi: http: //b/30945344

It's essentially a list of switch statements....

This is not very effective, but hey, you gotta try.... Else, you might also ask your BD team to go talk to GEMs, and get your app whitelisted in their devices. Money might change hands here.
The kicker here is that no GEM wants to sell a phone where the most. popular apps don't work as expected. So.... WeChat is pretty much always whitelisted by default, and so their own in-house push solution works great.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.105

GOOG-APPL-00100341

When talking about app compatibility in China, it's typically referring to a large subset of apps being not compatible with newer versions of Android. To be clear, this issue also exists in RoW, but the severity of it is in a different ballpark in China
VVhen Android O was in DP, the app incompat testing team tested the top 1000 apps on Play and on local Chinese app stores, and compared their incompat rates; the China app incompat rate is WAY HIGHER at 32.7'k vs "just" 1 3.7% in RoVV.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221. 1 06

GOOG-APPL-00100342

There are 2 big reasons why app compatibility is such a big problem in China -- (1) Obfuscation services *, and (2) Dynamic code loading libraries are very, very popular in China apps. Per our testing of top 1000 CN apps in 0 timeframe, about 70'/o of compatibility issues are due to obfuscation and DCL.
* In China, "obfuscation" means a lot more than just using Proguard) to protect apps from being unpacked / decompiled then modified / repacked and uploaded to all app markets
These have similar characteristics in that they both: Use numerous hidden APls Directly invoke dex2oat Manipulate and modify dex / so files Depend on concrete dex format (such as odex / vdex / cdex) beyond public dex layout Interfere with the platform's dex loading logic
Because obfuscation and DCL use a lot of internal knowledge of the Android platform, which often changes in new Android builds without public notification,, the apps built on top of such technologies often break on new Android OS upgrades. E.g. Android N introduced odex,,whose AOT compilation broke many DCLs thai inject some custom data into dex. As a result, many popular apps including VVeChat and Alipay suddenly crashed after being installed for a few days,,and developers spent -2

And the reason why DCL is used is simple... too many storesll
And worse,,as we have already explained, GEMs stores fight 3P stores for attention.... So devs have to figure out a way to take things into their own hands. Refer to this slide for more details.

To get a sense of how big this issue of app incompatibility is, consider this:
After we announced that Android P will start to enforce constraints on non-SDK interfaces (blog, DAC), Chinese developers filed requests for -800 (out of -1200) private interfaces for exemption requests during P preview. Requests from CN developers: https://b.corp.google.corn/hotlists/1 027617 (some FR contains many APls) Requests from RoVV developers: https://b.corp.google.corn/issues7q =componentid:328403'/o20-hotiistid ! 027617

As we have already established, there are many GEMs in China (-10 big ones, plenty of small ones). These devices also lack GMSCore and suffer from intentional / unintentionally inconsistent. behavior. (e.g. on some meizu device it just crashes when app tries to read phone book.)
(We also set up a dedicated project to prompt CN app compatibility. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact cn-app-compatcore@.)

The complexity in Android in China (so many app stores to distribute to, app stores fighting with one another, GEMs having a lot of leverage in the ecosystem but also contributing massively to fragmentation, etc.) makes things very difficult for developers, and users frequently see this pain.
Developers and users naturally gravitate towards an ecosystem with reduced complexity, but without sacrificing user reach......and it would be a pius if such an ecosystem were cross-platform too.

When we think of "user reach" in China, WeChat is the king of the hill. WeChat's prowess as a user engagement black hole is well-known, so this is just meant to be a simple overview.
What is less well-known is how WeChat services the "content creator" side of the equation - the publisher / business side.
Before 2017, there are 2 primary ways - as "subscription accounts", or "service accounts .

Before 2017, there are 2 primaryways thru which businesses engage with users on
VVeChat- as "subscription accounts" (iIIR]% ), or "service accounts" (%%% ) . l won't go into too much detail on what the differences between s ubscription accounts" and "service accounts" are. VVhat is important are what they both are -- they are templatized Ul with customizable menus for businesses to build on (Think Facebook pages for businesses.)
This means developers don "t have full control over the canvas - they are largely bound by the templates' look and feel. Devs can provide their own URLs that open in webviews in VVeChat - in essence, they are a dynamic bookmark of web links, laid out. in an orderly fashion.
That's great, but it's not really an app. Developers want more control.
(Feei free to read on the details with subscription and service accounts (and other nitty-gritty stuff) at this deck here.)

In Jan 2037, WeChat launched Mini-Programs - their take of a platformand
ecosystem, and essentially introducing an GS layer inside the outer Android GS. Discovery happens through a prominent tab within WeChat.
I' ll recommend checking out the go/wechat-miniprograms for a deep-dive, so this is a very high level overview of what it is.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.121

GOOG-APPL-00100357

After a slow start, it's now doing GREAT. Users now spend 20'/0 of all WeChat time in Mini-Programs.
New capabilities have also been added, e.g. off line-online scenarios (hyperlocal / nearby detection, proprietary 2D barcodes),,ads support, 3P extensions, etc.

Mini-Games (essentially just games on Mini-Programs) followed about 12 months later, and it drove quite a bit of growth as well. Data point: Nike paid 3M US dollars for an advertising spot in the Mini-Game hit "Jump Jump"
Mix of titles as well: Home-grown titles e.g. "Jump Jump'* - hundreds of millions uf users accumulated, with 7 day retention rate of 52'/0. Well-known titles, e.g. "Monument Valley 2" -- 4.8M users accumulated by March 2018, 2 months after launch

Ultimately, the big reason why it's doing weil is .... It's integrated into VVeChat! But besides that obvious reason..... VVhy is it doing wellV
My analysis for why VVeChat Mini-Programs have gotten the success that it has gotten so far. VVell-defined web-like framework, so devs don't have to deal with the complexity of the underlying layer. This makes it truly cross-platform. lt's also backward compatible, since VV eChat takes care of that part.
VVhen speaking of CN devs, they frequently mention how fast it is to build. Statements like "-3 day for a professional outsourcing company on a non-complicated job" are pretty common.

· ln th e beginning, devs were not so hot about the platform, and a well-defined rollout process turned out to be important that shows VVeChat's commitment to the platform
· Supp o rt for payments and identity (WeChat Pay and WeChat signin) · A2HS w orks (as long as OEM device allows for it)
· The f i r st 4 points mirror AMP's merits. · The l a st 2 points mirror where PVVAs want to get to but are not close to solving
across the whole mobile web ecosystem, especially in China but also more generally around the world.
· Stil l , IMO all of that pales in comparison to VVeChat's network effects+ prominent placement within VVeChat.

If you think Facebook (and Google) are aggregators, per Ben Thompson's aggregation theory, then WeChat is stepping right into aggregation on steroids.
GEMs and other3P apps are obviously threatened by WeChat's dominance; so how do they fight back'7 GEMs and other 3P Whales (those not named Tencent) scramble for a response to Mini-Programs.

To say that Tencent/ VVeChat's competitors in China are worried about VVeChat being a user engagement black hole is an understatement.
Alibaba actively tries to take user out of VVeChat and into their own properties.

AliPay and Baidu have both announced their own Mini-Programs ecosystem to get into the game.
AliPay has a massive user base as well with their Payments integration (which Wechat does not support), so it might be interesting.
(lt is harder to see how Baidu's take on this can succeed... they have neither the social graph nor the payments piece in place for users to re-engage).

As we have seen throughout this preso, a common theme is this ~ GEMs will insert themselves into critical user journeys to get a piece of the action.
VVith VVeChat getting a bigger and bigger slice of user engagement,,we see GEMs doing things thai only they can do through changes and event interception on ihe GS layer.
Let's look at some examples.

VVith Bixby 2.0's launch in China in 20 "l 7 November, Samsung took things one step further. Users can use their voice to basically command Bixby to click through screens and take actions on other apps (presumably using Android's Accessibility Service).
Note that there is NG APl integration here between Samsung and VVeChat (or other 3P apps). lt is unilaterally (AFAIK) something that the GEM (Samsung) has done. There is an opt-in function when a user enables Bixby, but once that happens, everything is fair game.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.135

As we have seen throughout this deck, GEMs is where things get most interesting.
They do not just want to become a dumb pipe for bits to flow through, but rather want to get a slice of the user engagement pie. Viewed from this lens, N/eChat's Mini-Programs is an existential threat to them.
Their answer - an alliance of GEMs supporting a new standard - launched abouts year after VVeChat Mini-Programs, and it's dubbed "Quick Apps".
A longer English explanation: https://medium.corn/Npandaily/huawei-xiaomi-and-7other-manufacturers-launch-unified-quick-app-nvaling-wechat-df537526d28

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221. 1 36

GOOG-APPL-00100372

In terms of developer experience, the similarities between Mini-Programs and Quick Apps are apparent: They both follow the "install-less" user interaction model (which really, is the same goal that both Instant Apps and PVVAs are striving towards, though thru different technical paths) l3evelopment will feei familiar to JS developers (CSS for styling, Node.js and NPM to pull in modules, etc.) Support for Payments, Auth, and Analytics
VVhere the technical advantages (and disadvantages) lie are also apparent: VVeChat Mini-Programs are truly cross-platform (works on Android and iGS, since VVeChat is the layer) Quick Apps, being blessed by the GEMs themselves, have a clear path towards solving those developer-facing problems described in this deck by abstracting away the underlying complexity. (e.g. letting Quick Apps be installed without friction, supporting Push, etc.)
(Not sure if this is official, but) some of the docs and example code are hosted on this domain https://www.w3cschool.cn/quickapp/, which goes to show how tightly coupled web development now is for such proprietary frameworks.

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.137

GOOG-APPL-00100373

The fact that Quick Apps are GEM-blessed is HUGE. It means that GEMs' apps (which are all pre-installed on those GEM devices) can serve as discovery channels for Quick Apps.
For Huawei, the Huawei App Store now shows Quick Apps in search results, and they have a curated section just for Quick Apps. Every time a Quick App is opened, there will also be a prompt for the user to add it to home screen, which then serves as the primary re-engagement mechanism.

For Xiaomi, in addition to the Xiaomi app store, they have also enabled the Xiaomi Browser as a discovery channel for Quick Apps. A search within the Browser will allow users to get to a Quick App in one-tap. For screenshots of other stores (I don't have all GEMs' phones unfortunately), check out this forum link.

Now the fear is.... 8/ill this phenomenon of Quick Apps and Mini-Programs also be exported abroad as these GEMs sell more and more devices outside of China (just like how it happened for Push Notifications)7
There are no official stats yet on how well (or not well) Quick Apps are doing, but there seems to be reasonable developer interest: Huawei and Xiaomi app stores both have hundreds of Quick Apps in the curated sections. Github has -600 repos with the term "(WIG>PH" (Github search doesn't allow specifying exact String matches though, so the actual number is probably fewer) https:iigithub.corn/search7q ='/OE5'/ OBF'/ DAB'/0 E5'/OBA'/094'/OE7'/094'/OA8 Google crawl of Github for exact match of the String "(PIG>N"

We have talked about this at some length, but it bears reiteratingAccessibility Service provides apps with the power to perform actions that would otherwise not be possible (without rooting anyway) ..... Click through other apps, read notifications, add floating Ul, etc. The Android framework gives freedom to users to decide if a particular app is "worthy" of getting this superpower; the user has to click through the Settings menu to grant an app access to this superpower.
This lends the Accessibility Service to abuse; as long as an app can convince a user to grant it access to the Accessibility Service, the app abusing the Accessibility Service (abuser) can pretty much do anything,, including going accessing the data of another app (abusee app).

GOOGLE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY DX-3221.141

GOOG-APPL-00100377

Most use cases come down to the abuser app helping the user perform tasks in another app (abusee). (As we shall see, some examples include: automatically skipping through ads, receiving red packet money quicker than anyone, etc.).
It should be acknowledged that many abuser apps that (ab)use Accessibility Services (besides actual accessibility-related use cases) do so with the intention of providing real user value. N/hile both the user and the abuser app have control over the experience, the abusee app has nocontroland no say over how the abuser app handles its data. The abusee app relies on the Play Store to enforce policy to restrict the behavior of abuser apps......

Red packet snatching is probably the most prominent example of Accessibility Service abuse.
(Background: it is Chinese tradition for folks to give money as gifts to others in the form of "red packets/envelopes". This is most common during Chinese New Year, in addition to other celebratory occasions - weddings, birthdays, etc. WeChat Pay gamified this experience ~ I can send V'lo to a WeChat group of 5 people, and set it. such that only the first 3 people get any money at all, first-come-first-served. Users are trained to keep checking their phone for incoming red packets, and this drove huge user engagement. AliPay and others soon followed suit with such a feature.)
There are A TON of red-packet snatching apps in market, the majority of which are using some form of Accessibility Service abuse to automate the process of receiving. This causes a lot of angst with WeChat/AliPay etc., as it essentially renders gamification as a form of user engagement tactic irrelevant.

Game playing automation through Accessibility Service is also emerging as a trend, especially with games which only require simple gestures to play.
Jump (It -- It) is one of the biggest hits on VVeChat Mini-Games platform, with 310M users on 7DAU of 52%. Its gameplay is super simple - users simply use a press-holdrelease gesture, and the figurine jumps a distance proportional to how long the user pressed-and-held the screen, trying to jump from one platform to another.
its success led to automation tools popping up (e.g. Auto.js), which uses Accessibility service to automate the gameplay.

"Domestic" - distribute only to local CN app stores. "Export" - distribute only outside of China (i.e. mainly to Play). For all intents and purposes, there is nothing different about them since the users that they serve are not in China. "Hybrid" - distribute to both Play and local CN stores .
