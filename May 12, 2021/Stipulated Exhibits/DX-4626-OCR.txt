Why this report?
Purpose: To measure satisfaction with the iPhone Developer Program (iDP) in order to provide the ADC team with recommendations on how to improve it
Key areas include:

Understanding iDP developers

Method: Developers were randomly selected from the Developer Database and invited to participate in a 15-minute Web survey. We conducted our research among a representative sample for both those who have successfully published Apps on the store and those who have not.Apple Market Research developed the questionnaire and used Chadwick Martin Bailey, an independent market research firm, to field the survey and tabulate results.
Statistical testing was conducted at a 95% confidence interval between developer groups (Apps vs. No apps). If data reported for one group is higher than the corresponding group for the same country, it is indicated with a upward arrow.
The term 'top-2 box' means the total percentage of the top 2 boxes of a 5-point scale.
Reminder of what we did: -5 top markets for those who submitted apps -- looked at 2 gro ups of iDP members- a pps on sto re, those without -- 3 key areas- what's the most i m p o r t ant part of iDP to them, how satisfied are they with everything in the iDP, membership/ satisfaction in other programs

Interestingly, not having an application review process is a pro for some, and a con for others
Google Android

Reasons forsatisfaction...
No application review process -- easy process
"Easy of development. No hoops tojump through to get to the API docs, community forums, blog, etc. "Simple submission, update process" "Easy to deploy apps for testing, evaluation, etc." "Simple setup of developing environment- No license required for device tests."
Free and open source
"-Free-Open Source --Noapproval process--IVfightierAPI(Camera access etc)."
"Because itis open source and the phone is not tied to a single service with contractual obligations."
Flexible
"- open architecture - supports development on non-Mac OS X machines (it would be greatifXcode was avarlable for Ubuntu/Linux- foriPhone/iPod/iPad
developemnt)." Inexpensive
"- price of entry ticketsis very low (don't have to buy a macjust for coding) N alot of freedom of development and display of applicatrons."
Rich API
"A rich API."

Reasons for dissatisfaction...
All over the place
'".Not so much the program as the multitude of devices have diferent requirements and feature sets, which means a lot of extra time is required for (especiaily) graphic and Ui development." "1/arying screen sizesand phones. Afore complicated thaniPhone development.
"Androidinvolves more technical expertise. Oocumentationisall over the place. Too many version changes."
Dislike Java
"Java development environment is terrible, not as broad of a reach or as good APls
as Apple.'s program."
No app review process
"I. No review process. Yes,it's easier on the developer butit's detrimental to the wholeecosystem. 2.I/arious screen resolutions. 9.Lackofdocumentation."
Poor visibility
"Android market apps have very poor visibility, Google doesn't do any marketing for Android apps. The Android Afarketinterfaceis not so user friendly."

Windows

Reasons forsatisfaction...
Lots of help available, better documentation (and morein Japanese)
"A lot ofbooks for development" "a lot ofdemos and tutorials" "Better tool support, clearly better documentation available" "Better documentation and more reliable development environment"
Open market/'collaboration, more flexible, no approval process
"A more open market (l can sell the products on my own, not through a specific store). More open collaboration among developers." "Ability to distribute apps with more flexibility -- i.e. free trial periods before purchase,crosspromotion via TrialPay,lower transaction fees,m ore advertising to purchase process analytics." "Fewer hoops tojump through to get an app distributed. More channels to distribute through. Familiar language (NET) to develop on."

Reasons for dissatisfaction...
Poor API
'"APl s'e»is incomplete- »ocr scattered and not enough conciseinformation.
Marke»place not wellsupported"
"Horrible APls"
No market place
'"Appiication distribution is a huge pain compared to the simplicity of the App Store."
Generally dislike MhndoI/vs
"General failure to keep up with the state of the artin mobile application development."
"General lack of a standard platform. Lots of work to make basic features work. Lack ofinnovation (although this may change with V7)"
"Lack ofdevelopersupport primarily. Developmentinformationis sparse and disjointed. The changein Mfindows Mobile platforms makesit hard to support all of theiterations and permutations consistently." "Microsoft's lack ofinterestin application development on the platform. Poor hardware.."

Reasons forsatisfaction...
Easy to use and free, Java-based
"Developing Java-based web appsis easy and free and thereis no delayin submission of updates." "Itis free. Based on Java, a language that everyone knows." "It's free (apart from a one-time $99fee for a codesigning certificate), well documented, and their tech supportis excellent."
Flexible
"Applications do not need to be approved before being distributed." 'With Blackberry I can sell or give away upgrades to my product whenever I want or feel itis better for my business. I can control entirely how I deliver the app

Reasons for dissatisfaction...
Overlycomplex
'7Ae progrcammincI language isn't intuit(vein my opinion and the community suppdrtis lacking. '
Steep learning cul've
"The development strategyis less uniform than on the iphone. There are too many phone models with diffei ent capabilities. The app storeis not as concrete and usabie as the (Phone app store, etc."'

Key Conclusions
· Most developers are generally satisfied with iDP, but about 12 -- 25% are dissatisfied
-- Non-English speaking countries (especially Japan) and those with no approved apps are slightly less satisfied with iDP
· App visibility in the App Store is the area of most dissatisfaction
-- Some specific complaints include: "too general" categories, search problems, and allowing too many "spam" apps in the store
· The App review process is also problematic for many, and it is the biggest deterrent for successfully developing and distributing applications
-- Developers complain roughly equally about the time it takes to hear back from the app review team, unclear criteria for rejection and lack of responsiveness

Key Conclusions
·While most developers were satisfied with the rest of the aspects of the iDP, other common complaints include (in
decreasing order of mentions):
-- Many developers would like Apple to eliminate the store-specific purchase quotas ($150), and simplify financials reporting in the website
-- Those dissatisfied with the application submission process find the legal requirements and documentation too daunting, confusing or time-consuming
-- Some have difficulty creating certificates and profiles
-- Although members are generally satisfied with the development resources on the website, many are clamoring for more sample code - -and more relevant sample code- - that is more easily searchable (and integrated with the iPhone reference library)
-- Overall satisfaction with the enrollment process is generally high, but some didn' t think the fee was recurring and others complained about the time it took
-- Beginner developers find the SDK too complex, and many want integration across the SDK tools

Key Conclusions
· A quarter of iPhone developers also develop for Android, and are generally satisfied with the experience
-- They value how Android makes it easy to develop, test and distribute, and they like the robust API. Some find the range of devices, and the platform itself, a bit chaotic, however.
· Developers highly value WMDC for its documentation, but dislike their store and Windows in general
· Developers feel that the Blackberry mobile community and the app store lacks support and clear documentation
