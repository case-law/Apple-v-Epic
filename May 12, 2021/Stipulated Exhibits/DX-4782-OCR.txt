Note: Only apps with at least one original in-app purchase transaction and at least one original initial download transaction are

included. Transactions where Apple is the developer are excluded. The percent of each in-app purchase monetization type is

calculated over the sum of in-app purchase revenue across all three in-app purchase monetization type categories. The ten genres

with the most App Store spending in FY2019 are shown. These genres make up 95% of FY2019 revenue on the App Store. See

Appendix E for details regarding Apple transaction data processing.
