Note: 2017 and 2018 sales figures represent "software revenue across all platforms (console, PC, portable, andmobilel, from

physical and digital sales, including in-game purchases and subscriptions." Sources indicate that 2010 to 2016 figures cover a similar universe. In each year, physical and digital revenues are estimated by multiplying total revenue by the share of revenue attributable to physical and dig'tal sales, respectively. At least as recently as 2017, the basis for the Entertainment Software

Association revenue estimates did not include "digital sales for Switch and 3DS games, or PC digital sales from Electronic Ar ts, Microsoft, Sony, Battle net, Origin, or Uplay."

Therefore, figures may underestimate total revenue. Advertising revenue from games is assumed not to be included.
