Great l If the OEMs can force thc game thmugb thc canicrs, that is much preferablci It will bc so much easier to deal with hardware companies, who have a strategic vision, than with the stagnant telecom monopolies.

Awesome! I love the Android mini-launcher approach too. Establishes away to get auto-updatesandlaunch Fortnite now, mops games and a rtopcfront later!

Here is our official plan for communicating with Google about bypassing the Google Play Store:

SAY NOTHING TILL IT SHIPS

Re Apple, there's no way for a nonWveloper nonnmterprise user to install software outside of the App Store, so I'm not sure there's a role for the mini-launcher there yet. If we want a multi-pmduct gateway on iOS, we could build the minilauncher into all of our games (underneath a top-level Epic icon in the menus) but the install links would need to redirect to the App Store. This is how WeChat handles game installation on iOS, unlike Android.

hhuk, we' ll need a plan for secmtly negotiating bundle deals with Android OEMs with a major presence outside of China, including SamsungandLG. Will need to be acoordinated international effort and needs to stay below the radar. We can offer each onesomereally cool branded bling exclusive to users who play Fortnite on their platform.

What's the timeline for this? We already designing Diesel with the mobile version in mind, but it seems we might need to prioritize that.

Chris Babcock (added) made a POC epic launcher yesterday, that's able to download, install and update a fortnite build on your phone. It works! Needs UX love but the principle is there. We can likely use this for internal deployment soon.

Will organize internal meetings next week

Worth doing that via in person meeting so we don't mess up external communicationy

This is awesome. Full speed ahead with this as the plan of record.

The benefit of focusing on IOS right now for initial launch is not to be underesxhnated and very likely a must. A lot of risk in current plans wrt Android compat/kperf, outside of general workload for online teams. We' re working through that tomoirow. We should decide quickly!
Also started explorations and quick prototyping on android launcher specifics, like Daniel outlined. Will document ill gdoc

system/launcher, jump through hoops to install our "store"/txx>

and for IHVs/carriers to

pre-load it onto their new devices.

Side benefits are that going platform exclusive with iOS allows us to focus our engineering efforts there to accelerate initial launch all while being able to negotiate extra support fmm Apple. Being on iOS first I assume is also going to build up demand for Android version which in turn should help negotiations udth caniers / phone manufacturers etc.

I wish I was more versed in the Android ecosystem:-/

Googling shows that there is clearly a way to pug this olf given how many there are and Ainazon has an offer as well.

ht~t,://foas~bes,corn/10 J oogleglsy-store-alternatives/

Can someone detail installation experience of Amazon Android app?

htt // wwwamazon com/androida

I assume technical challenges we need answers for are split into:

 getting launcher installed on device (side-loading)
 figuring out how to keep launcher updated (can you self patch your own
executable if you are side-loaded?)  figuring out how to install another app (aka launcher installing the game)  figuring out whether any of this changes if we are pre-installed by cartiers / IHVs / etc

And then making it all super user friendly and foot-proof.

I haven't used hockey app on Andmid, but on iOS it is pretty unusable. I assume this is due to platform contraints?

At some point the DOJ is going to break Apple's stranglehold on the app srtore...

Hockeyapp for instance is a website, dick download, install, done. No privilege escalation/dev settings/ at all needed. sideload=easy!
Chris Babcock is doing deeper investigations, e.g. how Hockey and "APKUpdater" work to install tk ~nate spps. Idea is to Download the mini-launcher directly through a web link, which then downloads/updates/patches FNBR APK. -art all

Avoiding the 30% is great but I will say that it would keep rne from installing it if the only way was to side-load: ) I realize that as long as< 39/o of people feel the same way, is a win!
Technically, it sounds doable yes.
But, most important to my end, we might lose the goodwill and support of Google (not that they do all that

(confidengal)

Arjan, Daniel, Josh,

What is the feasibility of launching Fortnite on Android as a stand-alone installable program, avoiding Google Play and their 3(yYotax? Perhaps 1-2 months alter iOS launch, atter we' re able to scale to handle the full volume of mobile users.
Do all Android devices support turning on side-loading? Could we launch with the game and a simple auto-updater (not the launcher, just an updated with no UI but a progress bar and cancel button)'/
I*m thinking Fortnite.corn could have the same "Download" button on Android as on PC/Mac that downloads the installer, and the landing page for the download button could have instructions for turning on side-loading.

This could get us to having a multiplatform (PC/Mac/Android) ecosystem much faster than other
avenues. Fortnite provides nearly unlunited free UA sufficient to overcome the friction of installing it.

Step 2, negotiate free bundling deals with all the major smartphone manufacturers.

Step 3, turn the auto-updater into a full version of the launcher on Android, so that Diesel will launch across all 3 platforms.

This is exactly the process Tencent followed to bypass Google Play with WeChat, which they soon opened up as a game distribution platform. The sooner we can free ourselves from the App Store distribution monopolies, the better, and the Fortnite launch on Andmid seems to me the one moment in time when we have sufficient gamer excitement to launch successfully and
build up a huge gamer base.
