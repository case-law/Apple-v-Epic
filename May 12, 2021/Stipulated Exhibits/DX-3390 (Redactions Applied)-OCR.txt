Thanks Matt. Great article. Few comruents:

* Short description would be pretty easy to add in iTC, DJ and App Review tools

* I like the idea of a download counter on each app details page

' Installing directly from the web - not sure we'd want this; has this been vetted in the past?

* 8 screenshots instead of 5 - sounds great but multiply that by the number of devices and the developers have an even bigger headache

o App Previews are 30 seconds, true; but we could have a secondary video for App Trailers which could be longer

* Changing metadatalscreenshots at any time: we' ve been there and slowly locked just about everything down except app description

' Highlighting a review on the app page: not sure that is rocket science but seems su sight forward

* Staged rollouts: I' ve heard this asked several tiines from developers myself. I'd be curious if more developers are asking for this one.

* Developers issuing refunds directly to customers - any idea if this has beena prevalent ask

from developers?

* Our App Analytics: coining soon
