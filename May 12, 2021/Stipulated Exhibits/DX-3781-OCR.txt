Key areas include:
· Overall satisfaction
· Importance of aspects of the iDP · Satisfaction and reasons for dissatisfaction · Aspects of the iDP that have impeded app development/

Understanding iDP developers

Method: Developers were randomly selected from the Developer Database and invited to participate in a 15-minute Web survey. We conducted our research among a representative sample for both those who have successfully published Apps on the store and those who have not. Apple Market Research developed the questionnaire and used Chadwick Martin Bailey, an independent market research firm, to field the survey and tabulate results.
Statistical testing was conducted at a 95% confidence interval between groups (Wave 1 vs. Wave 2). If data reported for one group is higher than the corresponding group for the same country, it is indicated with a upward arrow.
The term 'top-2 box' means the total percentage of the top 2 boxes of a 5-point scale.

Reasons why have not incorporated

lAAsL geLgck (Top reasons)

Reason for not incorporating iAd
Many developers don't see any benefit from incorporating iAds, and think they will take away from the app experience
Some suggested that they prefer to charge for their app instead of inflicting iAds on their users

Exam p l e verbatim
"Don't want to bombard paying customers with ads." --US developer
"In addition, I feel in paid apps customers will resent ads (they pay to keep app ad free)." -- UK developer "There really is no good place to put an iAd that would not intrude on the user experience." - US developer "Would be an unnecessary distraction."- -UK developer "Wish not to pollute the interface with advertisement... the iPhone's main assets being aesthetic and ergonomic, I don't want to interfere with the interface." --FR developer
"Would prefer to just charge a fair price than inflict ads on customers. That said, I respect that the iAd system strives to mitigate the negative aspects of ads; just keeping the user *inside* the app is a terrific step." --US developer "Since it's going to be a paid app, it will not have any kind of ads inside. Maybe someday I' ll make a free app with iAd. Not sure." --GE developer "Who pays for it should not be confronted with advertising." --GE developer

Time-factor: Need time to learn/have not had time to look into it/too busy

"Still learning the basics." --UK developer "Not had time to incorporate it yet, but planning to in my next app." --UK developer "Just haven't had time to look into this yet." --UK developer "There's no time to figure out how to use it." --JP developer

Reason for not incorporating iAd
Need more information about
It.
Most common mentions include: Want to know how it works, how to implement, iAd effectiveness and payment
de'taI Is

Exam p l e verbatim
"Don't really understand it." --JP developer "I would like to see first the ratio between the profits from low-priced apps that are not sold very often to free Apps with iAD." --GE developer "Not enough information." --JP developer "You haven't provided the clear instructions how to." --UK developer "You don't know what will show up. For example, want to avoid having an competitor's ad showed up in our app (and vice versa), the area where the ad will be is unclear. Would like to use it as soon as possible (buying and showing ads both)." - -JP developer

Not flexible enough: only works wl'th iOS 4.0

"It's only supported in iOS4 and later." --JP developer
"Requires iOS 4+." --UK developer "OS4 and iPhone 4 monopolize all our resources." --FR developer "It only works on iPhone and it only works on iOS 4! Most people never upgrade the firmware." --UK developer

NOt aware t ha t It IS aVaI lab) e I n "There's no iAd support outside of North America." --JP developer

their country (and/or for their speclfIc app)

"The service isn't available for Japan." --JP developer "That these are not yet available in Europe." --GE developer "Not used in the UK yet." --UK developer

lAAsL $3gck (Top reasons)

Reason for not incorporating iAd Plan to use in the future

Exam p l e verbatim
"Plan to use it in the future." --JP developer "Working on completely new version with loads of enhancements which will include an iAd version." --UK developer "Will integrate/test it in future software." --GF developer "Will be implemented in next update." --US developer

Program is too new

"Program still too recent to be convincing." --FR developer "Just started, too early." --US developer "Not tested." --FR developer "Lack of maturity on our market." --FR developer "It's very new." --US developer

Have not heard of it (particularly Japan and UK)

ABVQAAM So) rL)ons)

Suggestions for improvement
Improve and/or simplify the ability to track performance

Example verbatim
"With small apps, the scalability of charts makes it difficult to read; need more info about requests for ads and so on - - lack of clarity regarding what the information on the iAd web site means and implies to developers." --JP developer "Need a way to download it. Also need a summary for the month total too." --US developer "Very confusing.... please provide clearer scaling values and statistics." --GE developer "It is not possible to sort the table by date (incorrect sorting). Is it real-time? When will the ad be available outside the US?" --FR developer "I would love to see a combined way to track both iAd revenue and standard AppStore paid revenue similar to the AppFigures website." --US developer "Cannot navigate from iAd portal back to iTunes Connect main portal." --US developer

Improve fill rate

"We have iAd in 3 apps, 2 ofwhich have added thousands of requests but zero impressions. Why is this? We have no idea why one of our apps receives ads and 2 others do not. They are all using the exact same code and were all approved by Apple." --US developer "The fill rate is abysmally low, so my iAd-supported app looks just like the paid, full version...no ads!" --US developer "Want to confirm when the service will start in Japan. Fill rate is low." --JP developer
"The fill rate is currently very low. There is right now no way to find out why." --GE developer
"I have been very disappointed with the fill rate of iAds in my app: 0.0% after many weeks and several thousand requests." --UK developer

Suggestions for improvement
Mtould like to know when iAd is available globally

Example verbatim
"We at least want information regarding the availability of iAd in Europe." --FR developer "It would be good to let developers know that iAd currently only works in the USA." --FR developer "Do not announce: iAd is released globally and then do USA ONLY." --GE developer

Positive feedback: developers like real-time reporting

"Love the near real-time reporting!" --US developer "I love the iAd portal because it is live and has great data breakdown and graphing." -- US developer "I like how it updates near real time." --US developer "Easy and fun to use." --GE developer "Also excellent and almost real time!

Ease of Incorporating iAd in your app

nLgd feedback (Top reasons)

Suggestions for improvement
Simplify, make it easier

Example verbatim
"When you drop the component into IB, it should automatically add the necessary libs to your project in XCode." --US developer "We believe it would be essential to simplify the inclusion of iAds in an application, having to generate and include a profile for each application is cumbersome, we believe a string identifying the application would be much more flexible and more simple (similarly to networks such as Adwhirl or AdMob for instance)." --FR developer "iAd integration for combined iPhone/iPad apps and for 3.2 backward compatible apps was difficult to accomplish." --GE developer "I wanted iAds to be at the top of my entire application. This was difficult to incorporate when I had to add a subview to each view, so I attempted to encapsulate my entire tabview in another view, with iAds at the top. This caused problems with pushing/popping modal views and had inconsistent affects on automatically scrolling a tableview when the keyboard was visible." - US developer

Better documentation

"There NEEDS to be a source example for iAds as well as clear documentation of its requirements. I had to resort to a Google search to figure out what to include in the project. I had to guess what headers I needed and where they were. And my app was initially rejected because I didn't implement hiding of the banner if it's empty. All of this could have been avoided with a simple example or even more verbose documentation." --US developer
"The WWDC video had incomplete code and no simple samples were available. Took me many hours to get answers on the dev forum. In contrast, I integrated Mobclix into one of my apps in about 30 minutes due to their excellent documentation and sample code." --US developer
"I would have liked a complete example of code in addition to the video." --FR developer

r2igd feedback (Top reasons)

Suggestions for improvement
Make it available with other systems/devices (particularly
ios 3 and ipad)

Example verbatim
"You should make it easier to incorporate iAD on apps targeting iPhone OS3." --UK developer "We'd like to have an iPad version. The possibility of having your ad network would be interesting." --FR developer "I would like it on the iPad though." --US developer "Unless you want to drop support for iOS 3, the IB option isn't useful." --US developer "The lack of support for iOS 3.x proved to be quite annoying. I had search user forums for a way to keep my app from crashing for most users who can't or haven't yet upgraded to iOS 4 when a simple Sample Code application that checks for version of the OS or presence of the class would have been great." --US developer

Make it available in other countries (particularly Japan)

"Waiting for it to be offered in Japan." --JP developer "Please start this in Japan!" --JP developer "Hope that service will start in Japan soon." --JP developer "iAds aren't showing up in Japan yet, but it's attractive because the code is all there." --JP developer

cumbersome to develop for Google

Reasons for satisfaction...

Reasons for dissatisfaction...

Easy app review process
"No waiting with registration, un-bureaucratic and simple." --GE developer
"The procedure for the compilation/submission of applications is very simple, and moreover, there is no approval for the applications which allows for greater reactivity (even if it is a double-edged sword)." --FR developer
Free and open source
"Free for programming, more access to hardware, simple programming language." --GE developer
"Open source, few rules, simpler and clearer (contractual) conditions for developers." --CE developer
Flexible
"The fact of being able to develop an android application on Linux/OSX/Windows is a very big advantage, now the tools have nothing to do with yours, Xcode or even the simulator are just very, very useful for us to develop." --FR developer
Good documentation

All over the place (fragmented platfc)rm, lack of consistency)
"We' re making a port due to consumer demand only,, in general their documentation is poor and the segmentation of the market (so many different devices) makes it a real pain to develop for." --US developer
"Tools are a bit more cumbersome. Simulator is pretty dreadful. Fragmentation of the Android device market in terms of device capability and software versions -- although the IOS market is getting a bit like that now with iPad/iPhone4 and the older devices.*' --UK developer
"Code that should be easy to write takes a Iot more effort (the necessity to define resource ll3s and the use of various classes)." --JP develo.per
Poor app review process
"Submission process is shaky. There may be improvements but initially it was a terrible experience." - -US developer
"Registration, program uploads and releases are far too complicated and take too much administrative time and effort." --GE developer

"Abundance of information and samples." --US developer
Inexpensive fees

" Substandard platform means hardware can't be relied upon."- UK dev.clop.er
"The platform is unstable. The OS can easily get bogged down by multitasking and in the end the entire system becomes slow and unresponsive. The OS has no touch navigation. It is still requires pointers." --US developer
Challenging marketplace
"The process for submitting an application on the Marketplace is very tedious, filled with bugs. The process for getting paid is obscure, that is, incomprehensible: my application is the first paid application on the US market and I still haven't managed to get paid.

Reasons for dissatisfaction. · ·
Overly complex
"Poor developer tools. Confusing product line. *' --US developer
"It is complex. It does not have the nice slick feel of the app store, the variety of devices is huge and the interface of the devices are not very nici. The programme is. slow and to get an app promoted requires a lot of effort in time and money." --UK developer
DiNcult to use/navigate
"Rim's tools and dev environment are buggy." --UK developer
"Development environment not up to speed. API java not very effective. Generally speaking, the user experience for the BlackBerry platform is not satisfactory, which makes the development of applications not very profitable." --FR developer

Poor tools, documentation and API

"No problems with certifications. No waiting for App Review. No restrictions on what APIs can be used." - -US developer
"They also provide not only sample code, but video tutorials along with their documentation. They also offer developers discounted and sometimes free devices." --US developer
"Reviewing only takes 1-2 days. T here isn't a risk that Palm will reject my app for some unstated reason and then I'd never be able to distribute it.

Key Conclusions: iDP Satisfaction (1)
· Most developers are generally satisfied with iDP
-- Compared to last wave, developers in the US and UK are more likely to be very satisfied with the program
-- In general, JP developers are the least likely to be satisfied
·App visibility continues to be the area of most dissatisfaction; followed by the time it takes to get updates
on the store
-- For many, the increase in the number of apps in the store has had a negative effect on visibility, and others feel their apps are not featured prominently enough
·The App review process continues to be an issue for many, and it is still the biggest deterrent for successfully developing and distributing applications
-- Many complain about the lack of responsiveness from the review team, and how long it takes
-- However, compared to last wave, developers are slightly more satisfied with the
APL-APPSTORE 09324602

Key Conclusions: iDP Satisfaction (2)
·While most developers are satisfied with the rest of the aspects of the iDP, other common complaints include (in decreasing order of mentions):
Many would like downloads and sales report to be easier to read (e.g., with online dashboards, charts, sortable reports, better formatting, etc.)
Many would also want the sales data to be stored for longer
Some have difficulty creating certificates and profiles, and would also like to eliminate the 100-device limit
Those dissatisfied with the application submission process mentioned US-centric requirements for tax and banking information (international developers) and problems submitting metadata (particularly application screenshots)
Some would like the enrollment team to be more responsive to inquiries and provide more concise feedback
Although members are generally satisfied with the development resources on the website, some would like the iphone reference library to be better organized
Those new to Mac and/or users of different development platforms are more likely to find the tools hard to use and unintuitive

APL-APPSTORE 09324603

Key Conclusions: Recent changes to
· Less than half of all developers are aware of the new Member Center and Developer Support center · Consistent with open ended feedback from previous years, many developers are very satisfied with the fact that WWDC videos are available earlier
APL-APPSTORE 09324604

Key Conclusions: App promotion and
· Less than 20M of developers have incorporated iAd rich media ads in their application
