Hello Trystan, Just FYI in case this escalates through other channels.
Minecrafn Apple TV Edition for tvOS is requiringusers to sign in with or sign up for an Xbox live account in order to purchase consumable currency. Since the app as a single player mode we would require that users be able to access IAP without forced registration. We are mjecting for 5.1.1.
It appearsthisnewMarketplacefeatwe wasenabled intheiOSversionandwasapprovedin error wth this same 5.1.1 issue.
When I spoke to them today, they claimed that because they have a multi-platform shared marketplace for coins, they need users to be logged in to purchase. Pm setting up another call with them and the paimership manager to deliver the news that we are going to require them to allow purchase without sign in and to addrms this on the iOS app too.

Hello Trystan, The call has been made with the Minecraft team at Microsoft. They were happy with the revised guidance and agreed to the points detailed below.
- Incidental shared currency is OK --Apps must offer IAP for virtual currency - No buttons, links, emails or solicitation that direct iOS or tvOS users to other purchasingmechanisms - The app should be setup for IAP and users should not be directed inside or outside the app to purchase mechanisms other than IAP

Best regards, Bill

I think this makes sense and is even necessary.

We don't want to distribute apps that allow purchases of digital goods and services outside of the App Store. But we also have to allow apps that are cross platforin to work properly

for users. If users play Minecraft on for example the PC, and purchase goods there, and then run Minecraft on iOS or AppleTV with the same log on they would expect those goods to be there as welL I don't see any other way around this.

If anyone feels otherwise pleasesayso. I think this is abig deal.

For reference our current guideline is the following:

Guideline 3.1 "If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of

example: subscriptions, in-garne currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or

unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase."

Atter several discussions we believe we have a path forward for the Minecraft shared currency issue.

We are okay if there is incidental shared currency in Minecraft. The app must use IAP for virtual currency and there must be no buttons, external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than IAP.

Outside of the app there must be no links, emails or other solicitations that direct iOS/tvOS customers to purchasing mechanisms other than IAP.

The entire app experience must be setup for purchasing with IAP, and nothing the developer does in the app or outside the app is designed to encourage purchases for use on iOS happening anywhere but on iOS.

Unless anyone objects we would like to move forward with letting Minecraft know.
