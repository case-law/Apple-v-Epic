Sounds great! I agree with the priority points (thoughts Ryan?) but I think we might want to prioritize ¹2 because it feels like it's going to require the most work to support and largest amount of new APIs. 3-5 feel like they wouldn't be a great loss if they weren't supported to begin with.
Charles/Cristina - Who on our end would you like to run point for production? Can this person setup a sync for Mon/TuesthatworksforbothPSTandShanghai (GMT+8)?

I quickly went through the new features and here's a list of the ones mentioned by Apple:

1. People Occlusion

2. Motion Capture
3. Simultaneous Front and Back Camera 4. Multiple Face Tracking

5. Collaborative Sessions

I think ¹1 and ¹2 are pretty significant so they should probably get integrated first

For ¹5 1 think the engine already has some kind of support for it using UE4's networking system.

Not sure how critical ¹3 and ¹4 are as we don't use those features a lot within DG.

So yes1thinkwe can have async up nextMonday to discuss the detailsand wodc outa plan ofhow we can do this.
