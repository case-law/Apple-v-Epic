Notes:

[1] Includes both subscription and non-subscription digital content.

[2] App categories are determined from the Apple Transaction Data. Only original initial downloads are included for rankings by

download. Revenue is total revenue from in-app purchases and initial downloads. Apple's FY begins in October, meaning Q4 starts

in July and ends in September. For example, Ql FY 2 019 begins in October 2018.

[3] Includes the ability to purchase digital content on an Android device; a mobile, desktop, or laptop web browser; a downloadable

desktop or laptop app,,or any PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo device.

[4] This includes both desktop or laptop web browsers and mobile web browsers.

[5] An app is considered to contain in-app advertising if evidence of advertisements within iOS or Android was specifically found.

For example, some apps are listed as containing ads in Google Play but the same could not specifically be confirmed for iOS.

However, it is reasonable to consider apps with advertising in Android to also contain advertising in iOS.
