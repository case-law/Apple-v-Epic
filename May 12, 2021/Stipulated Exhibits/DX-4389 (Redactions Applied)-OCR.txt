Why are the Fieldrunner engineers working to port their app rather than get in-app purchase and a v.2 to the iPhone?

Subject: PSP Go Launch

Meriko asked me to pass this writeup along.

Tbe PSP Go launched yesterday. It's a key competitor to the iPhone/touch because Sony also relaunched the PSN Store (PSN= PlayStation Network) with digital game downloads and only
way you can get content onto the PSP Gois through the store.

- It retails for $250 which originally had a huge backlash. Reviews have settled somewhat though as people work out aPSP-3000 with a 16GB card actually costs $20 more.

- I 6GB of storage,expandableviamemorycardslot.

- Bluetooth with Bluetootb tethering. This mourn you can use a PS3 contmller to play games on the device.

- Despite mixed press the PSP go seems to have sold out at most retail locations (Kotaku)

-Component and analog video out

- PSP Minie launched with over I 00 game titles including iPhone pons of Fieldnmners R Hemes of Sparta

- PSN Store launched with over 90 full price PSP titles including Gran Turismo & Soulcaliber bringing the total number of games to around 200
- Sony Pictures / Columbia Blu Ray titles will switch from digital copy discs to PSN Movie codes only viewable on the PSP. Godzilla being the first example/experiment here.
- Sony is positioning itself against the App Store by highlighting their catalog as high quality.
- Sony is appealing to developers who perceive Apple's App Store approval process to be
) frustrating (I think Sony points this out more than there are actual developers
- Overall I think Sony is definitely responding to Apple's gaming push.
