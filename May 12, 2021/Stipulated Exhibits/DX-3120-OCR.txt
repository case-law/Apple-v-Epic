Apple's App Store and Other Digital Marketplaces
Over the last two decades, with advances in digital and mobile technologies, digital marketplaces have emerged as a new type of business model. Digital marketplaces are platforms that use digital technologies and tools to connect buyers and sellers. They have become ubiquitous in many sectors of the economy: examples include retail marketplaces such asAmazon and Etsy,ridesharing apps such as Uber and Lyft,travelplatforms such as Airbnb and Booking.corn, and food delivery platforms such as Grubhub and Uber Eats.
Digital marketplaces create value by facilitating and promoting valuable transactions between buyers and sellers. As a result, they typically share certain features that are critical to their management and success. Many digital marketplaces, for example, set up rules and policies to govern transactions and promote trust and reliability among both sellers and buyers. Some digital marketplaces also provide various services to users and invest in technology to improve the performance of the platform. In return, digital marketplaces typically charge fees based on the transactions they facilitate.
Apple's App Store ecosystem facilitates interactions between app developers and nearly one billion Apple device owners globally. To promote its success, Apple provides developers with distribution, search, and review services, as well as a set of tools to build and monetize apps. Apple also invests in the safety of the App Store and in developing new technologies and functionalities. While Apple charges developers an annual fee to enroll in its Developer Program and upload apps to the App Store, Apple does not charge developers to offer each individual app on the App Store, to distribute updates to users, or to access Apple's app analytics, marketing, and developer tools. Apple receives a commissionfrom developerswhen usersdownload paidapps and make in-app purchases of digital content, services, and subscriptions."
Study Goal The goal of this study is to compare the commission rates of Apple's App Store with those of other app stores and digital marketplaces, and to evaluate the App Store commission and associatedrules in thecontext ofthe business model used both by digital marketplaces and platforms in general.

Apple's App Store and Other Digital Marketplaces

Findings Our study shows that Apple's App Store commission rate is similar in magnitude to the commission rates charged by many other app stores and digital content marketplaces. The commission rates charged by digital marketplaces most similar to the App Store, such as other app stores and video game digital marketplaces, are generally around 30%.
Marketplacesthatdistribute digitalcontent such as videos,podcasts,eBooks, and audiobooks generally charge commission rates of 30% or more. Commission rates charged by e-commerce marketplaces vary by industry but sometimes exceed 30%.
Many sellers currently sell (or previously sold) their goods through brick-and-mortar stores and marketplaces. We find that sellers generally earn a substantially lower share of total revenue from the distribution through brick-and-mortar stores and marketplaces than through digital marketplaces such as the Apple App Store.

Digital Marketplaces and Their Business Models Digital marketplaces are relatively novel platforms. Some have disrupted entire industries such as hospitality, food delivery, or ridesharing. Some have expanded existing markets, while others created entirely new markets. All rely on improved technologies such as smartphones and video game consoles. Irrespective of their particular context, digital platforms share a set of characteristics and way of operating.
· Di gital marketplaces are two-sided platforms that connect sellers and buyers and provide them with an environment in which to interact and trade. For example, travelersand hosts can connect and transact through the Airbnb platform. Passengers and drivers can connect through the Uber and Lyft apps. And app stores connect app developers with device owners who are interested in those apps.
· A marketplace's attractiveness is determined primarily by its ability to bring on board enough buyers and enough sellers, in a way that preserves the platform's trust and integrity. By enrolling more high-quality sellers, a digital marketplace becomes more valuable to buyers. Similarly, by engaging more buyers, a digital marketplace becomes more valuable to sellers. This feature of digital marketplaces is known as an "indirect network effect."
· Di gital marketplaces provide tools and services to facilitate and encourage valuable interactions between buyers and sellers, or between developers and users. This involves upfront investments to build the platform, as well as continued

investments to enhance the platform with improved functionalities to maintain its appeal to all users of the platform. Such functionalities include helping users find productsthat match theirinterests and pay insecure ways. · Di gital marketplaces may provide more than matchmaking. Some invest in various tools and technologies to help sellers and developers offer innovative products and better ways to monetize them.
Apple's App Store exhibits features of a digital marketplace:
· Connecting developers and app users -- The App Store is a digital marketplace for app developers and Apple device users to interact and transact. The App Store enables developers of all sizes to distribute apps (and updates) to a large and valuable base of users throughout the world.' Users can download a variety of apps from many different developers.
· Attractindgevelopers and engaging app users -- Users have access toa diverse library of almost two million apps that have gone through Apple's app review process. All apps submitted to the App Store must abide by the App Store Review Guidelines, which set out standards for safety, performance, business, and design, as well as legal requirements.4 The goal of this review process is to ensure that all apps on the App Store are safe, thereby preserving the trust and integrity of the ecosyste m.
· Providing tools to encourage valuable interactions between developers and users -- Apple offers tools -- including secure payment services, app analytics, and reporting tools -- to assist developers in their marketing and sales efforts. Apple also continues to develop additional search functionalities and refine its search algorithm to help users find apps.
· In vesting in the ecosystem -- Apple invests in its ecosystem to attract and incentivize developers to create and sell innovative apps. One way it does so is by providing developers with tools, compilers, programming languages, libraries, application programming interfaces (APls), and software development kits (SDKs) to create, test, configure, and upgrade their apps. In addition, Apple makes its innovations and intellectual property available to developers, for example, through the useofcustom chips,cameras, operating system and securityfeatures,and cloud services.
Because the value of digital marketplaces comes from enabling and facilitating transactionsand making investments to support these transactions, digitalmarketplaces typically charge transaction fees. Transaction-based commission rates lower the barriers
The user base of the Apple App Store tends to be more affluent and has a greater propensity to spend on apps. See Omdia, App Ecosystems Forecast 20I9 --2024. See Apple's App Store Review Guidelines (https://developer. apple.corn/app-store/review/guidelines) and Kif Leswing, "Inside Apple's team that greenlights iphone apps for the App Store," CNBC (June 21, 2019).

to entry for small sellers and developers by minimizing upfront payments, and reinforce the marketplace's incentive to promote matches that generate high long-term value.
Comparison of the Commission Rates of Apple's App Store with Those of Other App Stores and Marketplaces
The Apple App Store's commission rates Apple chargesa commission when device owners download paidapps and make in-app purchases of digital content, services, and subscriptions.' Developers earn 70% of sales from paid apps and in-app purchases, and Apple collects a 30% commission. For in-app subscriptions, Apple charges a 30% commission for the first year. After that, Apple's commission falls to15%, meaning that developers' earnings increase to 85% of sales.
Developers can also monetize digital content and services on their apps in ways that do not involve transacting directly through the App Store, in which case Apple collects no commission. Specifically, developers can sell digital content, services, and subscriptions outside of the App Store that can be consumed and enjoyed within apps on Apple devices. In a recent study, we estimated that the revenue driven by app users' engagement with music and video streaming apps on Apple devices in the US is roughly twice as large as in-apppurchases through the App Store.'Fornewspapers, magazines, and audiobooks, this discrepancy is even greater, and enterprise apps are usually paid for by businesses and institutions entirely outside of the App Store despite being used by many employees, students, and others on Apple devices. Additionally, developers can monetize their digital content and services through in-app advertising, which is a large source of revenue for developers. This is especially true for gaming apps: In 2019, US game developers made more money from in-app ad sales on the iOS ecosystem than from billings through the App Store.
Developers can also monetize their apps in other ways, including through the sale of physical goods and services on their apps (such as grocery or food delivery apps). iOS apps facilitated more than $90 billion in sales of physical goods and services in the US in 2019. Apple receives no commission on such sales.
Comparison with other marketplaces and distribution systems To put Apple's commission rates in context, we reviewed commission rates used by a diverse set of digital marketplaces. Our review included four types of digital marketplaces, grouped by their business model and ordered according to their similarity with Apple's App Store: (1) other app stores and software distribution platforms, (2) video game digital marketplaces, (3) marketplaces that distribute digital content, and (4) e-commerce mar-
In addition, to upload apps, Apple charges developers a $99 annual fee for the Apple Developer Program and a $299 fee for the enterprise version. These fees are fixed and do not affect the commission rate on any individual app download, in-app purchase, or in-app subscription. Consequently, we do not consider these fees in our comparisons of commission rates in this report. These estimates are based on Apple data and the results of our earlier study LHow Large ls the Apple App Store Ecosystem: A Global Perspective for 201 9" (June 15, 2020).

ketplaces (that sell physical goods and services).'We also reviewed brick-and-mortar marketplaces and distributors. In this process, we relied on public information provided by the marketplaces themselves when available, and from reliable third-party sources otherwise.'

1. Other app stores and software distribution platforms
The closest comparison to Apple's App Store is provided by other large app stores and software distribution platforms. We reviewed the commission rates charged by large app stores -- including the Google Play Store (Google's app store for certified Android devices), the Amazon Appstore (for Amazon and Android devices), and Samsung's Galaxy Store (an Android app store for Samsung devices) -- as well as broader platforms such as the Microsoft Store which distributes software and games for computers and tablets that run onWindows and forXbox consoles.

As listed in Table 1, all these app stores charge the same standard commission rate as Apple (30%). Each has its own exceptions, particularly with respect to subscriptions. Commission rates of15% for subscriptions after12 months are on the low end of commission rates. For instance, similar to the Apple App Store, Google Play's commission rate for subscriptions is 15% after 12 months, and Amazon's commission is 20% for video streaming subscriptions. While the Galaxy Store charges a 30% standard commission rate, it explicitly states that this rate may be negotiable.

For Microsoft's software distribution platform, the commission is also 30% for all gamesincluding subscriptions -- and on certain stores (such as the Microsoft Store for Business and the Microsoft Store for Education), although it otherwise charges15% for non-game software and subscriptions for computers, tablets, and consoles.'Some app stores also charge xfeid account fees."

A detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between Apple's App Store, and the services that it provides, and these other digital marketplaces is beyond the scope of this study.
A detailed list of the commission rates, rules, and sources is included in the Appendix.
Starting in March 2019, Microsoft briefly lowered the15/0 commission rate it charged on qualifying sales to 5/0, before increasing it back to 15/0 in January 2020.
10 The Google Play Store charges a one-time $25 registration fee for a developer account. The Microsoft Store charges a one-time fee of $19 for individual developer accounts and $99 for company developer accounts.

Apple's App Store and Other Digital Marketplaces
We also reviewed the rates charged by a few other app stores, such as Aptoide (an open source Android app store) and LG SmartWorld (an Android app store for LG devices), which charge commissions in the 25 --30% range.
In China, in the absence of Google Play, dozens of competing Android app stores have sprung up. They include app stores from digital companies Tencent (MyApp) and Qihoo 360 (360 Mobile Assistant), from smartphone manufacturers (such as Huawei AppGallery, OPPO Software Store, Vivo App Store, and Xiaomi's MILII App Store), and from phone carriers (such as China Mobile's MM Store), among others. The commission rate charged by these app stores is often 50% or more."
Not all app stores have been successful, and some of them have closed. This is not unexpected as app stores, and digital marketplaces in general, need to attract a sufficient user base and offer developers attractive opportunities to thrive. We reviewed commission rates charged by app stores that have closed down, such as BlackBerry World, the Windows Phone Store, the Nokia Store, and Handango. The commission rates for these four now-defunct app stores were very similar, at least 30%.
2. Video game digital marketplaces Games represent a significant share of mobile apps, so video game digital marketplaces are a second natural comparison to app stores. In addition to being sold on mobile platforms, video games are also sold through the online stores of video game console makers such as Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (PlayStation), and Nintendo, or through digital video game distribution platforms such as Steam (owned by Valve) and Epic Games Store for PC gaming.
We reviewed the commission rates charged by large video game console makers and video game distribution platforms. As shown in Table 2, their commission rates are generally 30%. Steam's commission rate is volume-adjusted (30% for games earnings under $10 million, 25% for earnings between $10 and $50 million, and 20% for earnings above $50 million). An exception is the Epic Games Store, which charges a commission rate of12%""

Certain app stores may have lower rates (around 30/0). App stores that charge higher rates may provide expanded services,such as game promotion.

12 The Epic Games Store offers fewer features than Steam, and relies on exclusive distribution deals to build its digital distribution platform. See, e.g., Nick Statt, "Epic vs. Steam: The console war reimagined on the PC," The Verge (April 16, 2019). Epic also charges a 5/0 royalty on games sold on other marketplaces if they were developed usingEpic'sgame engine.

13

I/e also reviewed the commission rates charged by smaller online gaming platforms, such as itch.io, Game Jolt,

GOG.corn, Humble Store, and GamersGate. Their business models are more varied. GOG.corn, GamersGate, and

Humble Store are most similar to the larger stores and charge commission rates on game revenues of 25 --30/o.

Itch.io uses an open revenue sharing model, while Game Jolt charges at most10/0 on game revenue but 70/0 on

advertising revenue.

3. Marketplaces that distribute digital content
Aside from video games, a variety of digital content is published by platforms. These platforms are often specialized and less similar to Apple's App Store. Platforms that distribute digital content generally charge commissions in the 30 --50% range, as reflected in Table 3. While some of those platforms take a commission on paid transactions, others take a commission on advertising revenue, or both. Examples of such platforms include the following:

· Video content can be self-published and distributed through YouTube and Amazon Prime Video Direct. YouTube is reported to collect 45% of advertising revenues, while Amazon collects 50% of purchase and rental revenues. Video content can also be distributed through a "channel model," for example, through Roku. Roku collects 20% of purchases from viewers; it also collects the revenue from selling 30% of the advertising inventory of ad-supported channels.
· EBooks can be self-published and distributed on Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, Barnes 8 Noble's Nook, or Kobo. Their typical commission rates are in the 30 --35% range.
· Au diobooks can be self-published and distributed on Amazon's Audible platform, which charges a commission rate of 60 --75%,or on Kobo, which charges a commission rate of 55 --68%.
· Podcasts can be created, distributed, and monetized through platforms such as Spotify's Anchor, which charges a 30% fee on sponsorships (from advertisers) and a 9.5% fee on donations from listeners.
· Garners can livestream their play through Twitch, paying a commission fee of 50% on subscription revenue, in addition to a minimum of 25% on advertising revenue. Creators can post content and receive funding on Patreon's platform, for a commission of up to14.9%.

4. E-commerce marketplaces

E-commerce marketplaces serve as our fourth comparison set. A multitude of online marketplaces have emerged in the last 20 years, facilitating transactions in a wide set of industries. An important aspect of e-commerce marketplaces is that they use a variety of business models, and (largely) involve physical goods and services rather than digital content and services.

For e-commerce marketplaces, the commission rates and structure vary, as reflected in Table 4.'4 Examples of such marketplaces include the following:

· Ge neral online retail marketplaces include Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and Etsy, which typically charge sellers standard commissions ranging between 5% and 20% of the product price."
· Travel platforms that facilitate lodging include Airbnb, VRBO, and Booking.corn, which are reported to charge commissions of14 --20% of the total value of the booking.

14

So me e - commerce marketplaces charge separate fees to sellers and buyers.

15

On li n e retail marketplaces may assess additional fees, such as distribution and advertising fees, listing fees, or

certain fixed fees. For example, Amazon charges sellers on its e-commerce platform a monthly $39.99 fee for

a professional account. Online retail marketplaces may also charge membership fees on the buyer side (e.g.,

Amazon Prime fees).

· Ridesharing platforms such as Uber and Lyft are reported to charge fees amounting to about 20 --25% of the total ride prices.
· Food delivery platforms such as Uber Eats and Grubhub offer delivery services for a commission of 30% or more. (Commissions on pick-ups and self-delivery are lower, in the 15 --23% range, approximately.)
· Freelancing platforms for various types of workers include Upwork, TaskRabbit, and Spotify's SoundBetter, which charge fees between 5% and 20% of the service value.
· Ti cket resale marketplaces such as StubHub or Ticketmaster are reported to charge around 30 --37% commissions on the total ticket price.

5. Brick-and-mortar production, distribution, and marketplaces Examples of brick-and-mortar production, distribution, and marketplaces serve as our last comparison set. While their business models and cost structures vary significantly and are least similar to those of the Apple App Store, they nonetheless provide interesting insights.
First, we reviewed products that are (or were) sold in both digital and physical formats. These productsare most relevant because digitization has transformed how content producers can distribute their work, often reducing brick-and-mortar costs and allowing for a streamlined supply chain.
Depending onthe business model,coststructure,and supply chain organization,we reviewed and analyzed either (1) the share of the retail price that flows to content providers, (2) the commission charged by intermediaries, or (3) the costs of producing and distributing several products as physical goods when those costs are directly incurred by the content producer. Results from the second and third measure can be compared most directly with Apple's commission rate (30% or 15%), while results from the first method can be compared most directly with the share of revenues that developers receive after commission (70% or 85%).
· When video games are sold in brick-and-mortar stores, developers and publishers jointly collect up to an estimated 45% of the retail price. The remaining 55% goes to retail and wholesale margins, other distribution costs, and royalty fees collected by console makers. By contrast, on most digital video game marketplaces, including the Apple App Store, developers and publishers receive 70% of sales, with 30% going to the digital marketplace commissions. (See Table 2.) Distribution costs on digital marketplaces are limited, as developers are able to self-publish.
· Software developers typically received 30 -- 40o%f the retail price of boxed software before the advent of digital software downloads. The remaining 60 --70% went to distributors and retailers. By contrast, developers who distribute software via app stores or digital software distribution platforms typically collect 70 --85%of the sales price. (See Table 1.)
· Book publishing program Kindle Direct Publishing (from Amazon) charges commission rates between 40% and 60% for paperback books, leaving a similar share for the content creators. Kindle Direct Publishing and Barnes 8 Noble typically charge a 30 --35% commission to publish books digitally as eBooks. (See Table 3.) These commission rates are higher than the commissions charged by digital marketplaces, including the Apple App Store.
· For newspapers, physical production and distribution costs are estimated to be 50% ofrevenues,and formagazines, 60% of revenues. Newspapers and magazines sold as in-app purchases avoid these costs, and pay a15 --30% commission rate to distribute their product digitally. (See Table 1.)

DX-3120. 01 1

Apple's App Store and Other Digital Marketplaces

Second, we reviewed examples of brick-and-mortar distribution of physical products. We included marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers and charge commissions, such asauction houses and consignment stores.Although these marketplaces are very different from online platforms like the Apple App Store, their business models have some resemblance to those of digital marketplaces. We also included more traditional examples of brick-and-mortar distribution, such as car dealerships and retail stores, reviewing costs and fees associated with selling via such physical distribution channels.
· Art auctionhouses, such as Sotheby's,Christie's,and Bonhams, charge various types of fees, including a buyer fee of 20 --25% for amounts under $4 million and a seller fee estimated at10% on average. The sellers receive the rest.
· Consignment storesoften charge commissions ranging between 50% and 75%.
· Car dealerships often serve as intermediaries that sell used cars from old to new owners, with margins reported to be at least 20%. This means that the former car owners typically receive approximately 80% of the eventual resale price upfront. Just as in online markets for digital goods, trust is often difficult to ensure in used car markets. As a result, certain dealerships offer car certifications programs, which include car inspections and certain warranties."
· Food manufacturers pay fees to retailers for store placement, as well as other promotional fees, known as trade fees. These trade fees are estimated to account for15 --20%of the manufacturer's total sales revenue.
Digital marketplaces need rules and governance to thrive It is widely recognized that the success of digital marketplaces depends on their ability to connectbuyers and sellersand generate valuable interactions." Because trustand integrity are central to making buyers and sellers comfortable trading on the platform, digital marketplaces often employ common rules and enforcement strategies to foster such an environment. A lack of adequate policing and governance can undermine such trust and integrity, leading to an unsuccessful platform." Ridesharing apps perform background checks on drivers and use rating systems for drivers and riders. Apple, as m entioned aboveu,ses a strictvetting process to review the apps, ensuring that they are safe, reliable, and bring value to customers."

For example, in 1983, the video game industry crashed, causing more than 90% of game developers to go

bankrupt. That collapse was linked to a proliferation of unreliable, low-quality games. However, Nintendo was

able to resurrect the market a few years later, thanks to rules and policies aimed at expelling unauthorized games. These rules and policies were key to its success. See Kevin Boudreau and Andrei Hagiu, "Platform Rules:

Multi-Sided Platforms As Regulators," in Annabelle Gawer (ed.) Platforms, Markets and Innovation (2009).

Similarly, buyers are wary of using marketplaces riddled with seams.

Apple's App Store and Other Digital Marketplaces

In addition, for their business model to be successful, digital marketplaces often have to rely on rules that prevent customers from free riding on their services. Free riding involves buyers and/or sellers avoiding fees after the platform has helped connect them, which m eans thathe platform isnot compensated forthe successfulmatch and the use ofthe platform's technology, tools, and services to facilitate and promote valuable transactions between buyers and sellers. A review of the policies and rules of large app stores and online marketplaces that distribute physical goods and services -- marketplaces for which the risk for free riding is particularly high -- shows that digital marketplaces routinely forbid behaviors aimed at avoiding fees.
In addition to the commission on paid apps and in-app purchases of digital content, services, and subscriptions, Apple imposes guidelines that govern the use of the App Store. Among those policies are rules about in-app purchases to prevent users and developers from free riding on Apple's App Store services and investments. Apps cannot explicitly steer app users away from in-app purchases -- for example, by providing external linksthat bypass the App Store.
For apps that operate across multiple platforms, users can access content, subscriptions, and features acquired outside of the App Store ecosystem, e.g., through a website or an app on another platform. For instance, a subscription to Microsoft Office 365 purchased on a computer can be used in iOS apps without Apple collecting a commission. However, the same content, subscriptions, and features need to be available as in-app purchases within the app, except in the case of "reader apps." Reader apps can include magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VolP, cloud storage, and approved services such as classroom management. Examples of reader apps include Spotify, Netflix, and Kindle. Moreover, developers cannot direct iOS users to use another purchasing method, or discourage the use of in-app purchase.

The most prominent app stores and software distribution platforms (Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, Samsung's Galaxy Store, Microsoft Store, App Store) all use policies that require developers to pay commission fees, and use the platform's in-app payment system to purchase in-app digital products, with certain carve-outs for multi-platform apps. Additionally, most of those stores explicitly require that developers do not direct app usersto make purchases outside ofthe store.

· Ai rbnb's and VRBO's policies also address fee avoidance. For instance, Airbnb prohibits sellers from asking guests for contact information prior to booking, and controlshow hostsand guests communicate.
· Ub er and Lyft include restrictions that forbid drivers from charging for rides outside of the app or from doing "off-app" pickups.
· Freelancing services such as TaskRabbit, Upwork, and SoundBetter all use fee avoidance rules to ensure that payments are made through the platform.
