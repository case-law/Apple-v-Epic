(a) You will not take any action to interfere with the normal operation of any Apple Certificates, keys, or Provisioning Profiles; (b) You are solely responsible for preventing any unauthorized person or organization from having access to Your Apple Certificates and keys, and You will use Your best efforts to safeguard Your Apple Certificates and keys from compromise (e.g., You will not upload Your Apple Certificate for App Store distribution to a cloud repository for use by a third-party);
(c) You agree to immediately notify Apple in writing if You have any reason to believe there has been a compromise of any of Your Apple Certificates or keys; (d) You will not provide or transfer Apple Certificates or keys provided under this Program to any third party (except for a Service Provider who is using them on Your behalf in compliance with this Agreement and only to the limited extent expressly permitted by Apple in the Documentation or this Agreement (e.g., You are prohibited from providing or transferring Your Apple Certificates
that are used for distribution or submission to the App Store to a Service Provider), and You will not use Your Apple Certificates to sign any third party's application, pass, extension, notification, implementation, or site;
(e) You will use any Apple Certificates or keys provided under this Agreement solely as permitted by Apple and in accordance with the Documentation; and
(f) You will use Apple Certificates provided under this Program exclusively for the purpose of signing Your Passes, signing Your Safari Extensions, signing Your Site's registration bundle, accessing the APN service, and/or signing Your Applications for testing, submission to Apple and/or for limited distribution for use on Registered Devices or Authorized Test Units as contemplated under this Program, or as otherwise permitted by Apple, and only in accordance with this Agreement. As a limited exception to the foregoing, You may provide versions of Your Applications to Your Service Providers to sign with their Apple-issued development certificates, but solely for purposes of having them perform testing on Your behalf of Your Applications on Apple-branded products running iOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and/or tvOS and provided that all such testing is conducted internally by Your Service Providers (e.g., no outside distribution of Your Applications) and that Your Applications are deleted within a reasonable period of time after such testing is performed. Further, You agree that Your Service Provider may use the data obtained from performing such testing services only for purposes of providing You with information about the performance of Your Applications (e.g., Your Service Provider is prohibited from aggregating Your Applications' test results with other developers' test results).

You further represent and warrant to Apple that the licensing terms governing Your Application, Your Safari Extension, Your Site's registration bundle, and/or Your Pass, or governing any third party code or FOSS included in Your Covered Products, will be consistent with and not conflict with the digital signing or content protection aspects of the Program or any of the terms, conditions or requirements of the Program or this Agreement. In particular, such licensing terms will not purport to require Apple (or its agents) to disclose or make available any of the keys, authorization codes, methods, procedures, data or other information related to the Security Solution, digital signing or digital rights management mechanisms or security utilized as part of any Apple software, including the App Store. If You discover any such inconsistency or conflict, You agree to immediately notify Apple of it and will cooperate with Apple to resolve such matter. You acknowledge and agree that Apple may immediately cease distribution of any affected Licensed Applications or Passes, and may refuse to accept any subsequent Application or Pass submissions from You until such matter is resolved to Apple's reasonable satisfaction.

5.2 Rely i n g Party Certificates The Apple Software and Services may also contain functionality that permits digital certificates, either Apple Certificates or other third-party certificates, to be accepted by the Apple Software or Services (e.g., Apple Pay) and/or to be used to provide information to You (e.g., transaction receipts, App Attest receipts). It is Your responsibility to verify the validity of any certifications or receipts You may receive from Apple prior to relying on them (e.g., You should verify that the receipt came from Apple prior to any delivery of content to an end-user through the use of the InApp Purchase API). You are solely responsible for Your decision to rely on any such certificates and receipts, and Apple will not be liable for Your failure to verify that any such certificates or

Program Agreement

receipts came from Apple (or third parties) or for Your reliance on Apple Certificates or other digital certificates.

5.3 Nota r i zed Applications for macOS To have Your macOS Application notarized, You may request a digital file for authentication of Your Application from Apple's digital notary service (a "Ticket" ). You can use this Ticket with
Your Apple Certificate to receive an improved developer signing and user experience for Your Application on macOS. To request this Ticket from Apple's digital notary service, You must upload Your Application to Apple through Apple's developer tools (or other requested mechanisms) for purposes of continuous security checking. This continuous security checking will involve automated scanning, testing, and analysis of Your Application by Apple for malware or other harmful or suspicious code or components or security flaws, and, in limited cases, a
manual, technical investigation of Your Application by Apple for such purposes. By uploading Your Application to Apple for this digital notary service, You agree that Apple may perform such security checks on Your Application for purposes of detecting malware or other harmful or suspicious code or components, and You agree that Apple may retain and use Your Application for subsequent security checks for the same purposes.

If Apple authenticates Your developer signature and Your Application passes the initial security checks, Apple may provide You with a Ticket to use with Your Apple Certificate. Apple reserves the right to issue Tickets in its sole discretion, and Apple may revoke Tickets at any time in its sole discretion in the event that Apple has reason to believe, or has reasonable suspicions, that Your Application contains malware or malicious, suspicious or harmful code or components or that Your developer identity signature has been compromised. You may request that Apple revoke Your Ticket at any time by emailing: product-security©apple.corn. If Apple revokes Your Ticket or Your Apple Certificate, then Your Application may no longer run on macOS.

You agree to cooperate with Apple regarding Your Ticket requests and to not hide, attempt to bypass, or misrepresent any part of Your Application from Apple's security checks or otherwise hinder Apple from being able to perform such security checks. You agree not to represent that Apple has performed a security check or malware detection for Your Application or that Apple has reviewed or approved Your Application for purposes of issuing a Ticket to You from Apple's digital notary service. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is performing security checks solely in connection with Apple's digital notary service and that such security checks should not be relied upon for malware detection or security verification of any kind. You are fully responsible for Your own Application and for ensuring that Your Application is safe, secure, and operational for Your end-users (e.g., informing Your end-users that Your Application may cease to run if there is an
issue with malware). You agree to comply with export requirements in Your jurisdiction when uploading Your Application to Apple, and You agree not to upload any Application that is: (a) subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations; or (b) that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software and source code, without first obtaining that authorization. Apple will not be liable to You or any third-party for any inability or failure to detect any malware or other suspicious, harmful code or components in Your Application or other security issues, or for any ticket issuance or revocation. Apple shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses or other liabilities You may incur as a result of Your Application development, use of the Apple Software, Apple Services (including this digital notary service), or Apple Certificates, tickets, or participation in the Program, including without limitation the fact that Apple performs security checks on Your Application.

5.4 Cert i f i cate Revocation
Except as otherwise set forth herein, You may revoke Apple Certificates issued to You at any time. If You want to revoke the Apple Certificates used to sign Your Passes and/or issued to You
for use with Your macOS Applications distributed outside of the App Store, You may request that Apple revoke these Apple Certificates at any time by emailing: product-security©apple.corn. Apple also reserves the right to revoke any Apple Certificates at any time, in its sole discretion. By way of example only, Apple may choose to do this if: (a) any of Your Apple Certificates or

Program Agreement

Page 31

DX-4623. 031

APL-APPSTORE 10137294

corresponding private keys have been compromised or Apple has reason to believe that either have been compromised; (b) Apple has reason to believe or has reasonable suspicions that Your Covered Products contain malware or malicious, suspicious or harmful code or components (e.g., a software virus); (c) Apple has reason to believe that Your Covered Products adversely affect the security of Apple-branded products, or any other software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, or networks accessed or used by such products; (d) Apple's certificate issuance process is compromised or Apple has reason to believe that such process has been compromised; (e) You breach any term or condition of this Agreement; (f) Apple ceases to issue the Apple Certificates for the Covered Product under the Program; (g) Your Covered Product misuses or overburdens any Services provided hereunder; or (h) Apple has reason to believe that such action is prudent or necessary. Further, You understand and agree that Apple may notify end-users of Covered Products that are signed with Apple Certificates when Apple believes such action is necessary to protect the privacy, safety or security of end-users, or is otherwise prudent or necessary as determined in Apple's reasonable judgment. Apple's Certificate Policy and Certificate Practice Statements may be found at: http: //www.apple.corn/certificateauthority.
6. A pp l i c ation Submission and Selection
6.1 S ubm i s s ion to Apple for App Store or Custom App Distribution You may submit Your Application for consideration by Apple for distribution via the App Store or Custom App Distribution once You decide that Your Application has been adequately tested and is complete. By submitting Your Application, You represent and warrant that Your Application complies with the Documentation and Program Requirements then in effect as well as with any additional guidelines that Apple may post on the Program web portal or in App Store Connect. You further agree that You will not attempt to hide, misrepresent or obscure any features, content, services or functionality in Your submitted Applications from Apple's review or otherwise hinder Apple from being able to fully review such Applications. In addition, You agree to inform Apple in writing through App Store Connect if Your Application connects to a physical device, including but not limited to an MFi Accessory, and, if so, to disclose the means of such connection (whether iAP, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the headphone jack, or any other communication protocol or standard) and identify at least one physical device with which Your Application is designed to communicate. If requested by Apple, You agree to provide access to or samples of any such devices at Your expense (samples will not be returned). You agree to cooperate with Apple in this submission process and to answer questions and provide information and materials reasonably requested by Apple regarding Your submitted Application, including insurance information You may have relating to Your Application, the operation of Your business, or Your obligations under this Agreement. Apple may require You to carry certain levels of insurance for certain types of Applications and name Apple as an additional insured. If You make any changes to an Application (including to any functionality made available through use of the In-App Purchase API) after submission to Apple, You must resubmit the Application to Apple. Similarly all bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications, enhancements, supplements to, revisions, new releases and new versions of Your Application must be submitted to Apple for review in order for them to be considered for distribution via the App Store or Custom App Distribution, except as otherwise permitted by Apple.
6.2 A pp T h i nning and Bundled Resources As part of Your Application submission to the App Store or Custom App Distribution, Apple may optimize Your Application to target specific devices by repackaging certain functionality and delivered resources (as described in the Documentation) in Your Application so that it will run more efficiently and use less space on target devices ("App Thinning" ). For example, Apple may deliver only the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Your Application to a target device, and Apple may not deliver icons or launch screens that would not render on the display of a target device. You agree that Apple may use App Thinning to repackage Your Application in order to deliver a more optimized version of Your Application to target devices.

Program Agreement

Page 32

DX-4623. 032

APL-APPSTORE 10137295

As part of App Thinning, You can also request that Apple deliver specific resources for Your Application (e.g., GPU resources) to target devices by identifying such bundled resources as part of Your code submission (" Bundled Resources" ). You can define such Bundled Resources to vary the timing or delivery of assets to a target device (e.g., when a user reaches a certain level of a game, then the content is delivered on-demand to the target device). App Thinning and Bundled Resources are not available for all Apple operating systems, and Apple may continue to
deliver full Application binaries to some target devices.

6.3 i O S and IPadOS apps on Mac If You compile Your Application for iOS or iPadOS (collectively "iOS" for purposes of this Section
6.3) and submit such Application for distribution on the App Store, You agree that Apple will make Your Application available on both iOS and macOS via the App Store, unless You choose to opt
out of making Your Application available on macOS by following the opt out process in App Store Connect. You agree that the foregoing applies to an Application for iOS submitted by You and currently available on the App Store and to any future Application compiled for iOS and submitted by You to the App Store. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such availability on the App Store will apply only if such Application has been selected by Apple for distribution on the App Store
pursuant to Section 7 and only if such Application can function appropriately on, and be compatible with, macOS, as determined in Apple's sole discretion. You are responsible for obtaining and determining if You have appropriate rights for Your Application to operate on macOS. If You do not have such rights, You agree to opt out of making such Application available on macOS. You are responsible for testing such Application on macOS.

6.4 Bit c o d e Submissions For Application submissions to the App Store or Custom App Distribution for some Apple operating systems (e.g., for watchOS), Apple may require You to submit an intermediate representation of Your Application in binary file format for the LLVM compiler ("Bitcode"). You may also submit Bitcode for other supported Apple operating systems. Such Bitcode submission will allow Apple to compile Your Bitcode to target specific Apple-branded devices and to recompile Your Bitcode for subsequent releases of Your Application for new Apple hardware, software, and/or compiler changes. When submitting Bitcode, You may choose whether or not to include symbols for Your Application in the Bitcode; however, if You do not include symbols, then Apple will not be able to provide You with symbolicated crash logs or other diagnostic information as set forth in Section 6.6 (Improving Your Application) below. Further, You may be required to submit a compiled binary of Your Application with Your Bitcode.

By submitting Bitcode to Apple, You authorize Apple to compile Your Bitcode into a resulting binary that will be targeted for specific Apple-branded devices and to recompile Your Bitcode for subsequent rebuilding and recompiling of Your Application for updated hardware, software, and/or compiler changes (e.g., if Apple releases a new device, then Apple may use Your Bitcode to update Your Application without requiring resubmission). You agree that Apple may compile such Bitcode for its own internal use in testing and improving Apple's developer tools, and for purposes of analyzing and improving how applications can be optimized to run on Apple's operating systems (e.g., which frameworks are used most frequently, how a certain framework consumes memory, etc.). You may use Apple's developer tools to view and test how Apple may process Your Bitcode into machine code binary form. Bitcode is not available for all Apple operating systems.

6.5 Te st F l i ght Submission If You would like to distribute Your Application to Beta Testers outside of Your company or organization through TestFlight, You must first submit Your Application to Apple for review. By submitting such Application, You represent and warrant that Your Application complies with the Documentation and Program Requirements then in effect as well as with any additional
guidelines that Apple may post on the Program web portal or in App Store Connect. Thereafter, Apple may permit You to distribute updates to such Application directly to Your Beta Testers without Apple's review, unless such an update includes significant changes, in which case You

Program Agreement

Page 33

DX-4623. 033

APL-APPSTORE 10137296

agree to inform Apple in App Store Connect and have such Application re-reviewed. Apple reserves the right to require You to cease distribution of Your Application through TestFlight, and/or to any particular Beta Tester, at any time in its sole discretion.
6.6 Impr o v i ng Your Application Further, if Your Application is submitted for distribution via the App Store, Custom App Distribution or TestFlight, You agree that Apple may use Your Application for the limited purpose of compatibility testing of Your Application with Apple products and services, for finding and fixing bugs and issues in Apple products and services and/or Your Applications, for internal use in evaluating iOS, watchOS, tvOS, iPadOS, and/or macOS performance issues in or with Your Application, for security testing, and for purposes of providing other information to You (e.g., crash logs). Except as otherwise set forth herein, You may opt in to send app symbol information for Your Application to Apple, and if You do so, then You agree that Apple may use such symbols to symbolicate Your Application for purposes of providing You with symbolicated crash logs and other diagnostic information. In the event that Apple provides You with crash logs or other diagnostic information for Your Application, You agree to use such crash logs and information only for purposes of fixing bugs and improving the performance of Your Application and related products. You may also collect numeric strings and variables from Your Application when it crashes, so long as You collect such information only in an anonymous, non-personal manner and do not recombine, correlate, or use such information to attempt to identify or derive information about any particular end-user or device.
6.7 App A nalytics To the extent that Apple provides an Analytics service through App Store Connect for Applications distributed through the App Store, You agree to use any data provided through such App Analytics service solely for purposes of improving Your Applications and related products. Further, You agree not to provide such information to any third parties, except for a Service Provider who is assisting You in processing and analyzing such data on Your behalf and who is not permitted to use it for any other purpose or disclose it to any other party. For clarity, You must not aggregate (or permit any third-party to aggregate) analytics information provided to You by Apple for Your Applications as part of this App Analytics service with other developers' analytics information, or contribute such information to a repository for cross-developer analytics. You must not use the App Analytics service or any analytics data to attempt to identify or derive information about any particular end-user or device.
6.8 Com pa t i bility Requirement with Current Shipping OS Version Applications that are selected for distribution via the App Store must be compatible with the currently shipping version of Apple's applicable operating system (OS) software at the time of submission to Apple, and such Applications must stay current and maintain compatibility with each new release of the applicable OS version so long as such Applications are distributed through the App Store. You understand and agree that Apple may remove Applications from the App Store when they are not compatible with the then-current shipping release of the OS at any time in its sole discretion.
6.9 Se le c t ion by Apple for Distribution You understand and agree that if You submit Your Application to Apple for distribution via the App Store, Custom App Distribution, or TestFlight, Apple may, in its sole discretion:
(a) determine that Your Application does not meet all or any part of the Documentation or Program Requirements then in effect; (b) reject Your Application for distribution for any reason, even if Your Application meets the Documentation and Program Requirements; or (c) select and digitally sign Your Application for distribution via the App Store, Custom App Distribution, or TestFlight.

Apple shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including without limitation lost business opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities You may incur as a result of Your Application development, use of the Apple Software, Apple Services, or Apple Certificates or participation in the Program, including without limitation the fact that Your Application may not be selected for distribution via the App Store or Custom App Distribution. You will be solely responsible for developing Applications that are safe, free of defects in design and operation, and
comply with applicable laws and regulations. You will also be solely responsible for any documentation and end-user customer support and warranty for such Applications. The fact that Apple may have reviewed, tested, approved or selected an Application will not relieve You of any of these responsibilities.

7. Dist r i bution of Applications and Libraries

Applications:

Applications developed under this Agreement for iOS, watchOS, iPadOS, or tvOS may be distributed in four ways: (1) through the App Store, if selected by Apple, (2) through the Custom App Distribution, if selected by Apple, (3) through Ad Hoc distribution in accordance with Section 7.3, and (4) for beta testing through TestFlight in accordance with Section 7.4. Applications for macOS may be submitted to Apple for selection and distribution on the App Store, or may be
separately distributed.

7.1 Deli v e r y of Free Licensed Applications via the App Store or Custom App Distribution If Your Application qualifies as a Licensed Application, it is eligible for delivery to end-users via the App Store or Custom App Distribution by Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary. If You would like Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary to deliver Your Licensed Application or authorize additional content, functionality or services You make available in Your Licensed Application through the use of the In-App Purchase API to end-users for free (no charge) via the App Store or Custom App Distribution, then You appoint Apple and Apple Subsidiaries as Your legal agent and/or commissionaire pursuant to the terms of Schedule 1 for Licensed Applications designated by You as free-of-charge applications.

7.2 Sc he d u l e 2 and Schedule 3 for Fee-Based Licensed Applications; Receipts If Your Application qualifies as a Licensed Application and You intend to charge end-users a fee of any kind for Your Licensed Application or within Your Licensed Application through the use of the In-App Purchase API, You must enter into a separate agreement (Schedule 2) with Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary before any such commercial distribution of Your Licensed Application may take place via the App Store or before any such commercial delivery of additional content, functionality or services for which You charge end-users a fee may be authorized through the use of the In-App Purchase API in Your Licensed Application. If You would like Apple to sign and distribute Your Application for a fee through Custom App Distribution, then You must enter into a separate agreement (Schedule 3) with Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary before any such distribution may take place. To the extent that You enter (or have previously entered) into Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 with Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary, the terms of Schedule 2 or 3 will be deemed incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.

When an end-user installs Your Licensed Application, Apple will provide You with a transaction receipt signed with an Apple Certificate. It is Your responsibility to verify that such certificate and receipt were issued by Apple, as set forth in the Documentation. You are solely responsible for Your decision to rely on any such certificates and receipts. YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON SUCH CERTIFICATES AND RECEIPTS IN CONNECTION WITH A PURCHASE OF A LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. APPLE MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRES E N T ATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHA N T A BILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURP O S E, ACCURA CY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY, OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH APPLE

A.

Inte r n a l Distribution to Authorized Developers and App Store Connect users

You may use TestFlight for internal distribution of pre-release versions of Your Applications to a

limited number of Your Authorized Developers or Your App Store Connect users who are

members of Your company or organization, but solely for their internal use in testing, evaluating

and/or developing Your Applications. Apple reserves the right to require You to cease distribution

of such Applications to Your Authorized Developers or Your App Store Connect users through

TestFlight, or to any particular Authorized Developer or App Store Connect user, at any time in its

sole discretion.

B.

Ext e r n a l Distribution to Beta Testers

You may also use TestFlight for external distribution of pre-release versions of Your Applications

to a limited number of Beta Testers (as specified in App Store Connect), but solely for their

testing and evaluation of such pre-release versions of Your Applications and only if Your

Application has been approved for such distribution by Apple as set forth in Section 6.5

(TestFlight Submission). You may not charge Your Beta Testers fees of any kind to participate

in Apple's TestFlight or for the use of any such pre-release versions. You may not use TestFlight

for purposes that are not related to improving the quality, performance, or usability of pre-release

versions of Your Application (e.g., continuous distribution of demo versions of Your Application in

an attempt to circumvent the App Store or providing trial versions of Your Applications for

purposes of soliciting favorable App Store ratings are prohibited uses). Further, if Your

Application is primarily intended for children, You must verify that Your Beta Testers are of the

age of majority in their jurisdiction. If You choose to add Beta Testers to TestFlight, then You are

assuming responsibility for any invitations sent to such end-users and for obtaining their consent

to contact them. Apple will use the email addresses that You provide through TestFlight only for

purposes of sending invitations to such end-users via TestFlight. By uploading email addresses

for the purposes of sending invites to Beta Testers, You warrant that You have an appropriate

legal basis for using such emails addresses for the purposes of sending invites. If a Beta Tester

requests that You stop contacting them (either through TestFlight or otherwise), then You agree

to promptly do so.

third-party to aggregate) beta analytics information provided to You by Apple for Your

Applications as part of TestFlight with other developers' beta analytics information, or contribute

such information to a repository for cross-developer beta analytics information. Further, You

must not use any beta analytics information provided through TestFlight for purposes of deanonymizing information obtained from or regarding a particular device or end-user outside of

TestFlight (e.g., You may not attempt to connect data gathered through TestFlight for a particular

end-user with information that is provided in an anonymized form through Apple's analytics

service).

Libraries:

7.5 Dis tr i b ution of Libraries You can develop Libraries using the Apple Software. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Xcode and Apple SDKs Agreement, under this Agreement You may develop Libraries for iOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and tvOS using the applicable Apple SDKs that are provided as part of the Xcode and Apple SDKs license, provided that any such Libraries are developed and distributed solely for use with an iOS Product, Apple Watch, or Apple TV and that You limit use of such Libraries only to use with such products. If Apple determines that Your Library is not designed for use with an iOS Product, Apple Watch, or Apple TV, then Apple may require You to cease distribution of Your Library at any time, and You agree to promptly cease all distribution of such Library upon notice from Apple and cooperate with Apple to remove any remaining copies of such Library. For clarity, the foregoing limitation is not intended to prohibit the development of libraries for macOS.
