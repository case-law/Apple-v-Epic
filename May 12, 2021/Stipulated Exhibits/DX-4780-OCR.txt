Source: Apple transaction data Note: A free-to-download app with in-app purchase is defined as a free-to-download app that has at least one in-app purchase on or after October 1, 2018. A free-to-download app without in-app purchase is defined as a free-to-download app that has no in-app purchases on or after October 1, 2018. Only original transactions from in-app purchases and initial downloads are included. Transactions where Apple is the developer are excluded. The percent of each monetization type is calculated over the sum of apps across all three monetization type categories. The ten genres with the most App Store spending in FY2019 are shown. These genres make up 95% of FY2019 revenue on the App Store. See Appendix E for details regarding Apple transaction data processing.
