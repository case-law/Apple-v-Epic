Source: Apple transaction data

Note: In the year following the App Store's launch (July 10, 2008), the number of game transactions totaled 0.25 billion. In FY2019,

the number of game transactions totaled 3.52 billion. Apple's fiscal year begins in October, meaning Q4 starts in July and ends in

September. For example, Q1 FY2008 begins in October 2007. Only apps and in-app purchases categorized as games are included.

Transactions where Apple is the developer are excluded. Only original transactions from in-app purchases and initial downloads are

included. See Appendix E for details regarding Apple transaction data processing.
