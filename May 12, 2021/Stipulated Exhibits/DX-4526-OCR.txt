In 2015, we threw a lot at developers highlighted by two brand new platforms and App Stores. To simplify adoption of these new platforms, we unified our membership offerings for iOS, OS X, and Safari development into one Unified Apple Developer Program that supported all platforms including watchOS and tvOS.
Additionally, we made a change to allow anyone to develop apps for free with the membership fee only being required to distribute apps. (click>

Once the application is ready for some on device testing, developers can sign in with their Apple ID to create a free Apple Developer account.
Xcode is deeply integrated with the WWDR services and will automatically register a development device, generate a codesigning certificate and a provisioning profile all of which are needed to sign and install an app on their device.
For those who remember, this single step alone used to be almost 40 separate steps.

At this point, if a developer wants to distribute their application, they need to enroll in the Apple Developer Program. As I mentioned earlier, this single program supports distribution for IOS, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV apps.
Developers can enroll in the program either as an Individual, meaning they will sell their apps under their own name. Or they can enroll as a company which allows them to collaborate with their fellow employees and distribute their apps under their Organization name.

One of those resources is the iTunes Connect application. iTunes Connect provides all the tools needed to distribute apps, manage finances, and monitor app trends and analytics. The first thing a developer can do is set up their banking and tax information if they plan to charge for their app.

To accomplish this, we' re introducing a 7-day staffing program, working on a brand new OS X-based app to expedite the processing of app by reviewers, automating as many tasks as possible, and focusing on the uptime of the tools used by our review team. If a tool is down for a single day, thousands of apps pile up.

Nothing slows down review more than having to download, install, and process apps that haven't been tested at all and crash on launch. The better the state of the app coming into review, the faster the review process can be as a whole. And while an app may function perfectly for a reviewer, sometimes apps get released that have critical bugs on older hardware and a developer scrambles to ship an update.
To address these two problems, we' re focusing on augmenting features for beta testing with TestFlight, and giving developers more control of how their apps can be rolled out on the store.

Within TestFlight, we' re going to allow developers to simultaneously distribute multiple versions of their beta app so they can get a better idea of how the versions performs. Also, to facilitate tester management, groups are going to be introduced.
With staged rollouts, a developer can slowly rollout a new version of their app onto the App Store instead of it going live to all customers at the same time. This gives them time to react and stop a rollout of if a critical bug is discovered. And in that event, we' re going to introduce Version Rollback which will allow developers to immediately pull down the latest release of their app and revert to the last reviewed version without having to go back through App Review.

Last week, Resolution Center which is a way for App Review to communicate with developers, was integrated into the iTunes Connect Mobile application. Now devs immediately know when App Review needs to get in touch with them.
We' re also working on a Concierge-like support revamp which will provide a single point of entry for developer support requests and route them seamlessly to the specific Apple Team that can help them.
And in 2017, we' re planning to introduce live chat support and allow developers to respond directly to customer review on the App Store.

LOOKING AT OUR REGIONS, nearly THREE QUARTERS of our App Store customers in CHINA currently have no ability to pay whatsoever, meaning they DO NOT HAVE A PAYMENT METHOD ON FILE for their App Store or iTunes account

LATER THIS YEAR, WE WILL LAUNCH ALIPAY as a payment partner. A l ipay has 300 million users and controls roughly 50% of China's online payment market (Credit Suisse). OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS, we project that Alipay will bring in an additional 9.9M customers and $3I3 in incremental revenue. The CY16 impact is projected to be 1.4M incremental customers and $140M in billings.

...we recently hit road with 4 Introduction to iOS Development workshops in Cupertino, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, and New York City. We partnered with various STEM organizations for attendees and of the -200 (196 actual) students we welcomed, 78% were female and 90% represented an underserved minority. Over half (51%) were minors under 18.
Supported by -20 Apple Staff members, these one-day workshops taught students how to develop an iOS app from start to finish using Swift. No prior experience with Swift or Objective-C was required. The format of the workshops is a mixture of lecture and hands-on training culminating with a fully functioning Scavenger Hunt application which you actually saw earlier in our Day in the Life of a Developer Walkthrough.

"-"-"-"-BACKUPINFO ON LY"-"-"-"-
The scavenger hunt app the students develop contains the following features: и Display a list of items to find и Add items to the list и Take a picture of an item и Show the picture in a list и Check off found items

-- And for WWDC this year, we' re doubling down. We want the community at WWDC to better reflect our wider developer audience, and even better our overall global customer audience. We want to have people building products that will appeal to all consumers.
We' re starting close to home by increasing the diversity of our own speakers but we' re focusing as well on general attendees and scholarship winners.
For the first time ever, we' re going to capture demographic data of anyone who registers for the WWDC ticket selection process.
Our scholarship program will remain at 400 but we' re going to over 150 travel assistance grants in partnership with STEM organizations NCWIT and TMCF. (50 paid by Apple, 50 paid by NCWIT, 50 paid by TMCF)
Aspirations in Computing is a talent development pipeline initiative of the National Center for Women 8 IT (NCWIT) designed to increase women' s meaningful participation in computing careers awards and this year they have 30 winners from the Bay Area. We' re going to extend a scholarship to each of those young women.
This year, Apple has 30 interns from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and 12 who are from Code2040. While they' ll all be working in various departments across the company, we want to extend an invitation to all of these interns to attend the conference, meet other scholarship winners, and learn as much as they can.

apps and games, ultimately raising nearly $14M for the Global Fund to support their mission of creating an AIDS Free Generation. Coming off the success of Apps for (RED), we wanted to continue our support of Apple's mission to leave the world better than we found it.
