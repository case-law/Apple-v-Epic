This survey was a cross-functional endeavor between:  App Store Marketing
 App Store Business Management  iTunes Analytics  and the Market Research & Analysis team led by Melinda Sammons This is an abridged version of the report. This report focuses on US respondents; we have also surveyed UK respondents and are working with the Market Research team to finalize reporting. The initial draft of the UK report indicates that responses are very consistent with those of the US respondents. Once the UK report is finalized we will make it available to the team.

Method:Apple Market Research conducted an online survey with 3,530 app developers in the US who are at least somewhat involved in business or marketing decisions. Respondents were screened to exclude those whose companies are not located in the US. Results are weighted to match the distribution of size based on categories assigned by Developer Relations.
Statistical testingacross large and mid tier developers compared to small tier developers was conducted at a 95% significance level and is indicated with arrows. To simplify reporting, results of statistical testing may not be shown for values under 5%.
Other notes;To simplify reporting, chart labels for values under 3% may not be shown. The term "top-2 box"/ bottom-2 box refers to the total of the top 2 results/ bottom 2 results in a 5-point scale. Totals, sub-totals, and nets may be off by a point or two due to rounding.
A PPLE CONFIDENTIAL 3
We conducted this survey From December 2014 to January 2015. We sent the survey to a range of developers, including our approximately 300 US managed developers. We got a low response rate from our managed developers so we retargeted them in February and are still assessing the results. We attribute the low response rate to the time of year -- we were delayed in getting the survey out and it was sent right around Christmastime -- so a learning for the next survey is to get it out to developers by October. This is how we did the research: An online survey was emailed to US developers  respondents had at least 1 app published on app store in past 2 years  respondents had to identify being at least somewhat involved in business or marketing decisions

 We worked with the Analytics team to define "small", "mid" and "large" tier developers. Tiers were based on downloads rather than billings.  The top developers contribute a large proportion of our downloads. To accommodate this top-heaviness, the buckets are scaling in size -- we bracket by 99th percentile for large/
98th to 90th for medium and 89th and below for small.  We received the majority of responses from developers who fall into the "small" tier, which was consistent with our expectations.

We looked at results by whether respondents were involved in business or marketing decisions, and the findings were virtually similar between the two groups, so we' re showing the results in total (except where the question was only asked of 1 group). What was more interesting was looking at results by developer tier, so most charts show the results this way.
Where you see arrows, that denotes comparison to small-tier developers.
To begin we asked how many apps hasyour company published on the App Store inthe last two years; 47% have published 2-5 app.

APPLE CONFIDENTIAL
When we asked developers to then select the one area where they expect to drive the most growth for their iOS app business next year, what was notable was that international expansion is not expected to be a primary area of growth. This could be attributed to the barrier to entry presented by localization and a lack of market expertise.
Another takeaway from this slide is that large developers are focusing on retention and engagement rather than just on user acquisition. This shift in focus to monetizing existing users is a growing trend we' re seeing.

Of little surprise, revenue topped all choices at 32% overall, Revenue was especially key for large developers, coming in at just shy of 50%. Customer engagement/time spent was next, almost equally as important across large, medium and small developers.

In terms of app updates, we asked developers if they planned updates around any of the listed events. Multiple selections were allowed here.
Far and away, developers plan updates around updates that make to the IOS. Large developers especially plan around our updates. Developers clearly know that integrating new product features into their apps is the way to go. Apple product launches are also key, especially for Large and Mid tier devs. Interesting is the App Store Refresh. For large developers, this came in at 37%, but it falls dramatically down to 15% for Medium and 7% for Small. The same can be said for App Store Promotions (36% -- 10%% --4%) -- it appears that the small developers likely are not aware of the benefits of releasing on these dates or haven't been working with Apple and thus haven't been guided to do so. The App Store best practices documentation we are working on will help here.

We then asked if they conduct sales or promotions for their paid apps? Due to the small response size, here we combined large/mid developers. -- Across the board, about half do.

A PPLE CONFIDENTIAL 2 5

So, we wanted to find out when they conducted these promotions. Again, multiple response allowed.
By scanning the list from top-to- bottom, you see that large/mid tier developers conduct sales more often that small developers around every event other than "other" As a whole, developers follow very similar price promotion cycles as traditional brick and mortar: j.) Thanksgiving/black Friday, 2) Christmas/Hanukkah, 3) back to school As you can see, large and mid tier developers are more willing to experiment with pricing and are more nimble in trying different pricing approaches.

Finally, we wanted to hear how developers measure success from a sale or promotion (Again, multiple responses were allowed)
Here the clear winner is Downloads at 74% across the board, evenly split across all tiers. Once again, top/mid developers are more focused on revenue/billings: 41% of large/mid developers derive success from billings while only 23% of small developers do. Acquiring new users very important as well. Featuring more important here than on previous questions, but still only about 26%.

We asked developers what their top three most effective marketing channels were for driving downloads of their apps on the App Store. Word of mouth ranked as an important marketing channel, particularly for small developers.

Overall, 3/5 have expanded internationally. As we expected, this number was much higher for Large developers and dropped for Mid and then even lower for Small developers. All that said, it's good to see that each tier is above 50%. The years that we' ve spent championing the importance of international are clearly paying off.

How do they go about marketing internationally?
Similar to the previous slide, a little over j./4 use market research. Additionally, roughly j./3 of large developers also use local user acquisition channels and creative localization services. Small developers are less likely to use local UA channels or creative localization services, and we believe it is because they don't know where to start or which partners to trust.

Consistent with the previous slide, developers are asking us to help localize, provide guidance on user acquisition channels and cultural and market differences. These are all areas the App Store is focusing on in the guidance we' re creating on entering new markets.
Google is providing localization services at 3-S cents per word, which, by industry standard, is cheap. We need to consider what services we can be offering.

No big surprises here as they' re focused on the top global markets: china (2), uk, germany (4) and japan Interesting to see that the large developers skew lower in the UK and US and higher in China and Japan. Given their maturity in the app space, they' re likely further ahead in terms of localizations than smaller developers.

For UA, developers either measure cost by install or the cost annually, so we wanted to get a sense for both. This slide shows cost per install, and as you can see, 86% of developers don't pay anything for their UA. This could be because the analytics tool provider uses the developers' data for its own purposes and is therefore able to offer their services at no cost.
[e.g., providing a multi-purpose SDK that tracks UA and also delivers ads]

Now how about discoverability of apps..
There is much more negative sentiment here. Overall, 34% Strongly or Somewhat agree that the App Store enables discoverability and more than 50% fell into Strongly Disagree or Somewhat Disagree, with 32% strongly
disagreeing.
The negative sentiment was worse among mid and small tier developers; however, it's clear that this is an issue across the board.

We anticipate that iTC App Analytics and the App Store best practices we are creating for Apple Developer will help improve this rating in future surveys, but we need to be thinking about what more we can provide.

So we asked what tools could we provide to help developers make better business decisions
Analytics far outdistanced any of the other options and were of most interest to larger developers, which shouldn't come as a surprise. Discoverability, which we' ve now seen come up a few times throughout the survey, came in next, with everything else falling in under 10%.

For those who don't have any previews on the App Store we asked why not. 28% say the footage is too difficult to capture, while 27% are waiting to submit an app update.
24% of large developers say the preview guidelines are too restrictive. App Review policy around app preview footage has changed since this survey was sent out, so it will be interesting to see whether this percentage changes in future surveys.
Open answers for "other" responses included npreviews are not within my skill set" nno capacity to explore this feature", "limited resources" "wasn't even sure what uapp previews" were until I just Googled it" "haven't gotten around to it yet", "haven't had time" "can't justify the cost" or "effort vs reward"
We have been working with the Analytics team to measure the conversion rate of apps with app previews, and it has been determined that they are effective in improving conversion rate. When we are able to share this with developers it will encourage wider adoption.
We also need to provide better guidance on how to create app previews so that developers are able to create great app previews on their own.

So, what have we learned' ?
 Avoid major cultural holidays Discoverability and analytics are the top asks from developers
 Many developers have little to no marketing budgets  We need to demonstrate effectiveness of our tools using data  We need to continue to demonstrate the ROI of localization  Developers are looking for guidance to help them make smarter business decisions
In short, we learned a lot. Here are some of our key takeaways: 톆e won't be sending this survey out before a major cultural holiday again.  Better discoverability and analytics are the top asks from developers. We are continuing to refine our guidance on App Store optimization, and the release of ITC App Analytics this
quarter will definitely make strides in addressing these pain points  Our scaled developer outreach needs to provide actionable guidance for the 66% of all developers who are operating on little-to-no marketing budget.  If we want to influence adoption of our features and tools, we need to have data to support their effectiveness. 톆e need to demonstrate ROI of localization and provide local market expertise, which we' re working on providing as part of our scaled developer outreach. 톆e need to help developers make smarter business decisions on business models, pricing strategies, engagement and monetization. We need to provide more transparency on
how the App Store works (e.g., store turn). And we need to better communicate the existing guidance we have.
