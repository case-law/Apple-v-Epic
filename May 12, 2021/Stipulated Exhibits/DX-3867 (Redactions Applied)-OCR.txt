Hey Aaron,

latforms. I believe you' re the guy who pulls financial/commerce numbers across the p

If not, please let me know

who I should reach out to.

I' ve noticed that ecom tmnsactions for our Epic/PC platform have been shrinking. I believe this is largely due to
addingnew platforms like mobileand Switch. Moreover, Ibelieve users'purchase behavior may have changed with the addition of mobile, especially Apple and more recently Android apps, where users are just logging onto their mobile app to purchase. Meaning, most players are still playing on PC/Epic platform as they did before, but purchasing on other platforms like mobile because it may be easier and more convenient ie when the store updates. It seems that PC/Epic acorn may have been impacted most by the additional of these platforms.

Separately, I have a concern that disabling accounts from Fraud since May could also be impacting our PC playerbase.We disableaccountsforanychargebacks,butalsofraudtransactionsIlagged bybanks.Thiscould be pushing away users from the PC platform.

I want to solidify my beliefs and theories by confirming it with data. I also want to understand how big of an issue this may be.

 Have you done an exerrcise like this before for anyone else?  How would you recommend we look at this? DAU/MAU by platform and transactions by platform over time?  Can we go back towhen Apple was added to look attrends?
 How to best look at the fraud disabling impact?  Other thoughts?

This is noturgent, but itis a concernfor measImanageour PC/Epic ecombusiness.

Happy to jump on a chat to discuss.

Thanks! Wen-Jen
