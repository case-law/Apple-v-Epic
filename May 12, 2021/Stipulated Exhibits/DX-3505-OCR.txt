· Facilitating the sale or purchase of illegal drugs or prescription drugs without a prescription. · Depicting or encouraging the use or sale of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco by minors. · Instructions for growing or manufacturing illegal drugs.

User Generated Content
User-generated content(UGC) is content that users contribute to an app, and which is visible to or accessible by at least a subset of the app's users.
Apps that contain or feature UGC must:
· require that users accept the app's terms of use and/or user policy before users can create or upload UGC; · define objectionable content and behaviors(in a way that complies with Play's Developer Program Policies), and
prohibit them in the app's terms of use or user policies; · implement robust, effective and ongoing UGC moderation, as is reasonable and consistent with the type of UGC hosted
by the app · In the case of live-streaming apps, objectionable UGC must be removed as close to real-time as reasonably possible; · In the case of augmented reality(AR) apps, UGC moderation (including the in-app reporting system) must account
for both objectionable AR UGC(e.g. a sexually explicit AR image) and sensitive AR anchoring location(e.g. AR content anchored to a restricted area, such as a military base, or a private property where AR anchoring may cause issues for the property owner); · provide a user-friendly, in-app system for reporting objectionable UGC and take action against that UGC where appropriate; · remove or block abusive users who violate the app's terms of use and/or user policy; · provide safeguards to prevent in-app monetization from encouraging objectionable user behavior.
Apps whose primary purpose is featuring objectionable UGC will be removed from Google Play. Similarly, apps that end up being used primarily for hosting objectionable UGC, or that develop a reputation among users of being a place where such content thrives, will also be removed from Google Play.
Here are some examples of common violations:
· Promoting sexually explicit user-generated content, including implementing or permitting paid features that principally encourage the sharing of objectionable content.
· Apps with user generated conten(tUGC) that lack sufficient safeguards against threats, harassment, or bullying, particularly toward minors.

For additional information on the unapproved or misleading pharmaceuticals and supplements that we monitor, please visit www.legitscript.corn.

Intellectual Property
When developers copy someone else's work or use it without required permission, it might harm the owner of that work. Don't rely on unfair use of other people's work.

Intellectual Property
We don't allow apps or developer accounts that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others (including trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and other proprietary rights). We also don't allow apps that encourage or induce infringement of intellectual property rights.
We will respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. For more information or to file a DMCA request, please visit our copyright procedures.
To submit a complaint regarding the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods within an app, please submit a counterfeit notice.
If you are a trademark owner and you believe there is an app on Google Play that infringes on your trademark rights, we encourage you to reach out to the developer directly to resolve your concern. If you are unable to reach a resolution with the developer, please submit a trademark complaint through this form.
If you have written documentation proving that you have permission to use a third party's intellectual property in your app or store listing (such as brand names, logos and graphic assets), contact the Google Play team in advance of your submission to ensure that your app is not rejected for an intellectual property violation.

Unauthorized Use of Copyrighted Content
We don't allow apps that infringe copyright. Modifying copyrighted content may still lead to a violation. Developers may be required to provide evidence of their rights to use copyrighted content.
Please be careful when using copyrighted content to demonstrate the functionality of your app. In general, the safest approach is to create something that's original.
Here are some examples of copyrighted content that is often used without authorization or a legally valid reason:
· Cover art for music albums, video games, and books. · Marketing images from movies, television, or video games. · Artwork or images from comic books, cartoons, movies, music videos, or television. · College and professional sports team logos. · Photos taken from a public figure's social media account. · Professional images of public figures. · Reproductions or "fan art" indistinguishable from the original work under copyright. · Apps that have soundboards that play audio clips from copyrighted content. · Full reproductions or translations of books that are not in the public domain.

Encouraging Infringement of Copyright
We don't allow apps that induce or encourage copyright infringement. Before you publish your app, look for ways your app may be encouraging copyright infringement and get legal advice if necessary.
Here are some examples of common violations:
· Streaming apps that allow users to download a local copy of copyrighted content without authorization. · Apps that encourage users to stream and download copyrighted works, including music and video, in violation of
applicable copyright law:

Trademark Infringement
We don't allow apps that infringe on others' trademarks. A trademark is a word, symbol, or combination that identifies the source of a good or service. Once acquired, a trademark gives the owner exclusive rights to the trademark usage with respect to certain goods or services.
Trademark infringement is improper or unauthorized use of an identical or similar trademark in a way that is likely to cause confusion as to the source of that product. If your app uses another party's trademarks in a way that is likely to cause confusion, your app may be suspended.
Counterfeit
We don't allow apps that sell or promote for sale counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.

Privacy,Deception and Device Abuse
We' re committed to protecting user privacy and providing a safe and secure environment for our users. Apps that are deceptive, malicious, or intended to abuse or misuse any network, device, or personal data are strictly prohibited.

User Data
You must be transparent in how you handle user data(e.g., information collected from or about a user, including device information). That means disclosing your app's access, collection, use, and sharing of the data, and limiting the use of the data to the purposes disclosed. In addition, if your app handles personal or sensitive user data, please also refer to the additional requirements in the "Personal and Sensitive Information" section below. These Google Play requirements are in addition to any requirements prescribed by applicable privacy and data protection laws.

Personal and Sensitive Information
Personal and sensitive user data includes, but isn't limited to, personally identifiable information, financial and payment information, authentication information, phonebook, contacts, device location, SMS and call --related data, microphone, camera, and other sensitive device or usage data. If your app handles sensitive user data, then you must:

· Limit your access, collection, use, and sharing of personal or sensitive data acquired through the app to purposes directly related to providing and improving the features of the app(e.g., user anticipated functionality that is documented and promoted in the app's description in the Play Store). Apps that extend usage of this data for serving
advertising must be in compliance with our Ads Policy.

2/1 4/2021

Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) - Play Console Help

. Post a privacy policy in both the designated field in the Play Console and within the app itself. The privacy policy must,

together with any in-app disclosures, comprehensively disclose how your app accesses, collects, uses, and shares user

data. Your privacy policy must disclose the types of personal and sensitive data your app accesses, collects, uses, and

shares and the types of parties with which any personal or sensitive user data is shared.

· Handle all personal or sensitive user data securely, including transmitting it using modern cryptography(for example, over HTTPS).

· Use a runtime permissions request whenever available, prior to accessing data gated by Android permissions.

· Not sell personal or sensitive user data.

Prominent Disclosure and Consent Requirement In cases where users may not reasonably expect that their personal or sensitive user data will be required to provide or improve the policy compliant features or functionality within your app(e.g., data collection occurs in the background of your app), you must meet the following requirements:
You must provide an in-app disclosure of your data access, collection, use, and sharing. The in-app disclosure:
· Must be within the app itself, not only in the app description or on a website; · Must be displayed in the normal usage of the app and not require the user to navigate into a menu or settings; · Must describe the data being accessed or collected; · Must explain how the data will be used and/or shared; · Cannot only be placed in a privacy policy or terms of service; and · Cannot be included with other disclosures unrelated to personal or sensitive data collection.
Your in-app disclosure must accompany and immediately precede a request for user consent and, where available, an associated runtime permission. You may not access or collect any personal or sensitive data until the user consents. The app's request for consent:
· Must present the consent dialog clearly and unambiguously; · Must require affirmative user action(e.g. tap to accept, tick a check-box);
· Must not interpret navigation away from the disclosure(including tapping away or pressing the back or home button)
as consent; and · Must not use auto-dismissing or expiring messages as a means of obtaining user consent.
Here are some examples of common violations:
· An app that accesses a user's inventory of installed apps and doesn't treat this data as personal or sensitive data subject to the above Privacy Policy, data handling, and Prominent Disclosure and Consent requirements.
· An app that accesses a user's phone or contact book data and doesn't treat this data as personal or sensitive data subject to the above Privacy Policy, data handling, and Prominent Disclosure and Consent requirements.
· An app that records a user's screen and doesn't treat this data as personal or sensitive data subject to this policy. · An app that collects device location and does not comprehensively disclose its use and obtain consent in accordance
with the above requirements · An app that collects restricted permissions in the background of the app including for tracking, research, or marketing
purposes and does not comprehensively disclose its use and obtain consent in accordance with the above requirements.

Specific Restrictions for Sensitive Data Access In addition to the requirements above, the table below describes requirements for specific activities.

2/1 4/2021 EU-U.S. Privacy Shield

Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) - Play Console Help

If you access, use, or process personal information made available by Google that directly or indirectly identifies an individual and that originated in the European Union or Switzerland("EU Personal Information" ), then you must:

· Comply with all applicable privacy, data security, and data protection laws, directives, regulations, and rules;
· Access, use or process EU Personal Information only for purposes that are consistent with the consent obtained from the individual to whom the EU Personal Information relates;
· Implement appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect EU Personal Information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized or unlawful access, disclosure, alteration and destruction; and
· Provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles C> .

You must monitor your compliance with these conditions on a regular basis. If, at any time, you cannot meet these conditions (or if there is a significant risk that you will not be able to meet them), you must immediately notify us by email to data-protection-officelgoogle.corn C> and immediately either stop processing EU Personal Information or take reasonable and appropriate steps to restore an adequate level of protection.

Permissions
Permission requests should make sense to users. You may only request permissions that are necessary to implement current features or services in your app that are promoted in your Play Store listing. You may not use permissions that give access to user or device data for undisclosed, unimplemented, or disallowed features or purposes. Personal or sensitive data accessed through permissions may never be sold.
Request permissions to access data in context(via incremental auth), so that users understand why your app is requesting the permission. Use the data only for purposes that the user has consented to. If you later wish to use the data for other purposes, you must ask users and make sure they affirmatively agree to the additional uses.
Restricted Permissions
In addition to the above, restricted permissions are permissions that are designated as Dangerous, Special or Signature, and are subject to the following additional requirements and restrictions:
· Sensitive user or device data accessed through Restricted Permissions may only be transferred to third parties if necessary to provide or improve current features or services in the app from which the data was collected. You may also transfer data as necessary to comply with applicable law or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets with legally adequate notice to users. All other transfers or sales of the user data are prohibited.
· Respect users' decisions if they decline a request for a Restricted Permission, and users may not be manipulated or forced into consenting to any non-critical permission. You must make a reasonable effort to accommodate users who do not grant access to sensitive permissions(e.g., allowing a user to manually enter a phone number if they' ve restricted access to Call Logs).
Certain Restricted Permissions may be subject to additional requirements as detailed below. The objective of these restrictions is to safeguard user privacy. We may make limited exceptions to the requirements below in very rare cases where apps provide a highly compelling or critical feature and where there is no alternative method available to provide the feature.

SMS and Call Log Permissions
SMS and Call Log Permissions are regarded as personal and sensitive user data subject to the Personal and Sensitive Information policy, and the following restrictions:

Restricted Permission

Requirement

Your app manifest requests the Call Log permission group(e.g. READ CALL LOG, WRITE CALI LOG, PROCESS OUTGOING CALLS)

It must be actively registered as the default Phone or Assistant handler on the device.

Your app manifest requests the SMS permission group(e.g. READ SMS, SEND SMS, WRITE SMS, RECEIVE SMS,RECEIVE WAP PUSH,
RECEIVE MMS)

It must be actively registered as the default SMS or Assistant handler on the device.

Apps lacking default SMS, Phone, or Assistant handler capability may not declare use of the above permissions in the manifest. This includes placeholder text in the manifest. Additionally, apps must be actively registered as the default SMS, Phone, or Assistant handler before prompting users to accept any of the above permissions and must immediately

stop using the permission when they' re no longer the default handler. The permitted uses and exceptions are available on

this Help Center page.

Apps may only use the permission (and any data derived from the permission) to provide approved core app functionality Core functionality is defined as the main purpose of the app. This may include a set of core features, which must all be
prominently documented and promoted in the app's description. Without the core feature, the app is "broken" or rendered unusable. The transfer, sharing, or licensed use of this data must only be for providing core features or services within the app, and its use may not be extended for any other purpose (e.g., improving other apps or services, advertising, or marketing purposes). You may not use alternative methods (including other permissions, APls, or third-party sources) to derive data attributed to Call Log or SMS related permissions.

Location Permissions Device location is regarded as personal and sensitive user data subject to the Personal and Sensitive Information policy and the following requirements:
· Apps may not access data protected by location permissions (e.g., ACCESS FINE LOCATION, ACCESS COARSE LOCATION,ACCESS BACKGROUND LOCATION ) afterit is no longer necessaryto delivercurrent features or services in your app.
· You should never request location permissions from users for the sole purpose of advertising or analytics. Apps that extend permitted usage of this data for serving advertising must be in compliance with our Ads Policy.
· Apps should request the minimum scope necessary (i.e., coarse instead of fine, and foreground instead of background) to provide the current feature or service requiring location and users should reasonably expect that the feature or service needs the level of location requested. For example, we may reject apps that request or access background location without compelling justification.
· Background location may only be used to provide features beneficial to the user and relevant to the core functionality of the app.
Apps are allowed to access location using foreground service (when the app only has foreground access e.g.: "while in use") permission if the use:
· has been initiated as a continuation of an in-app user-initiated action, and · is terminated immediately after the intended use case of the user-initiated action is completed by the application.
Apps designed specifically for children must comply with the Designed for Families policy.

All Files Access Permission
Files and directory attributes on a users device are regarded as personal and sensitive user data subject to the Personal and Sensitive Information policy and the following requirements:
· Apps should only request access to device storage which is critical for the app to function, and may not request access to device storage on behalf of any third-party for any purpose that is unrelated to critical user-facing app functionality.
· Android devices running R (Android 11, API Level 3)0or later, will require the MANAGE EXTERNAL STORAGE permission in order to manage access in shared storage. All apps that target R and request broad access to shared storage ("All files access") must successfully pass an appropriate access review prior to publishing. Apps allowed to use this permission must clearly prompt users to enable "All files access" for their app under "Special app access" settings. For more information on the R requirements, please see this help article.

Device and Network Abuse
We don't allow apps that interfere with, disrupt, damage, or access in an unauthorized manner the user's device, other devices or computers, servers, networks, application programming interfaces (APls), or services, including but not limited to other apps on the device, any Google service, or an authorized carrier's network.
Apps on Google Play must comply with the default Android system optimization requirements documented in the Core App Quality guidelines for Google Play.
An app distributed via Google Play may not modify, replace, or update itself using any method other than Google Play's updatemechanism. Likewise,an appmay notdownload executable code (e.g.dex,JAR,.so files) from a source other than Google Play. This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine and has limited access to Android
APls (such as JavaScript in a webview or browse)r.
We don't allow code that introduces or exploits security vulnerabilities. Check out the App Security Improvement Program to find out about the most recent security issues flagged to developers.

Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) - Play Console Help

Our Malware policy is simple, the Android ecosystem including the Google Play Store, and user devices should be free

from malicious behaviors (i.e. malware). Through this fundamental principle we strive to provide a safe Android

ecosystem for our users and their Android devices.

Though varied in type and capabilities, malware usually has one of the following objectives:

· Compromise the integrity of the user's device. · Gain control over a user's device. · Enable remote-controlled operations for an attacker to access, use, or otherwise exploit an infected device. · Transmit personal data or credentials off the device without adequate disclosure and consent. · Disseminate spam or commands from the infected device to affect other devices or networks. · Defraud the user.

An app, binary, or framework modification can be Potentially Harmful, and therefore can generate malicious behavior, even if wasn't intended to be harmful. This is because apps, binaries, or framework modifications can function differently depending on a variety of variables. Therefore, what is harmful to one Android device might not pose a risk at all to another Android device. For example, a device running the latest version of Android is not affected by harmful apps which
use deprecated APls to perform malicious behavior but a device that is still running a very early version of Android might be at risk. Apps, binaries, or framework modifications are flagged as malware or PHA if they clearly pose a risk to some or all Android devices and users.

The malware categories, below, reflect our foundational belief that users should understand how their device is being leveraged and promote a secure ecosystem that enables robust innovation and a trusted user experience.

Visit Google Play Protect for more information.

Backdoors
Code that allows the execution of unwanted, potentially harmful, remote-controlled operations on a device.
These operations may include behavior that would place the app, binary, or framework modification into one of the other malware categories if executed automatically. In general, backdoor is a description of how a potentially harmful operation can occur on a device and is therefore not completely aligned with categories like billing fraud or commercial spyware. As a result, a subset of backdoors, under some circumstances, are treated by Google Play Protect as a vulnerability.

Billing Fraud
Code that automatically charges the user in an intentionally deceptive way.
Mobile billing fraud is divided into SMS fraud, Call fraud, and Toll fraud.
SMS Fraud
Code that charges users to send premium SMS without consent, or tries to disguise its SMS activities by hiding disclosure agreements or SMS messages from the mobile operator notifying the user of charges or confirming subscriptions.
Some code, even though they technically disclose SMS sending behavior, introduce additional behavior that accommodates SMS fraud. Examples include hiding parts of a disclosure agreement from the user, making them unreadable, and conditionally suppressing SMS messages from the mobile operator informing the user of charges or confirming a subscription.
Call Fraud
Code that charges users by making calls to premium numbers without user consent.
Toll Fraud
Code that tricks users into subscribing to or purchasing content via their mobile phone bill.
Toll Fraud includes any type of billing except premium SMS and premium calls. Examples of this include direct carrier billing, wireless access point (WAP), and mobile airtime transfer. WAP fraud is one of the most prevalent types of Toll fraud. WAP fraud can include tricking users to click a button on a silently loaded, transparent WebView. Upon performing the action, a recurring subscription is initiated, and the confirmation SMS or email is often hijacked to prevent users from noticing the financial transaction.

A Note on Uncommon Apps

Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) - Play Console Help

New and rare apps can be classified as uncommon if Google Play Protect doesn't have enough information to clear them as safe. This doesn't mean the app is necessarily harmful, but without further review it can't be cleared as safe either.

A Note on the Backdoor Category
The backdoor malware category classification relies on how the code acts. A necessary condition for any code to be classified as a backdoor is that it enables behavior that would place the code into one of the other malware categories if executed automatically. For example, if an app allows dynamic code loading and the dynamically loaded code is extracting text messages, it will be classified as a backdoor malware.
However, if an app allows arbitrary code execution and we don't have any reason to believe that this code execution was added to perform a malicious behaviour then the app will be treated as having a vulnerability, rather than being backdoor malware, and the developer will be asked to patch it.

Mobile Unwanted Software

This policy builds on the Google Unwanted Software Policy by outlining principles for the Android ecosystem and the Google Play Store. Software that violates these principles is potentially harmful to the user experience, and we will take steps to protect users from it.
Mobile Unwanted Software At Google, we believe that if we focus on the user, all else will follow. In our Software Principles and the Unwanted Software Policy, we provide general recommendations for software that delivers a great user experience. This policy builds on the Google Unwanted Software Policy by outlining principles for the Android ecosystem and the Google Play Store. Software that violates these principles is potentially harmful to the user experience, and we will take steps to protect users from it.
As mentioned in the Unwanted Software Policy, we' ve found that most unwanted software displays one or more of the same basic characteristics:
· It is deceptive, promising a value proposition that it does not meet. · It tries to trick users into installing it or it piggybacks on the installation of another program. · It doesn't tell the user about all of its principal and significant functions. · It affects the user's system in unexpected ways. · It collects or transmits private information without users' knowledge. · It collects or transmits private information without a secure handling (e.g., transmission over HTTPS) · It is bundled with other software and its presence is not disclosed.
On mobile devices, software is code in the form of an app, binary, framework modification, etc. In order to prevent software that is harmful to the software ecosystem or disruptive to the user experience we will take action on code that violates these principles.
Below, we build on the Unwanted Software Policy to extend its applicability to mobile software. As with that policy, we will continue to refine this Mobile Unwanted Software policy to address new types of abuse.
Transparent behavior and clear disclosures
A// code should deliver on promises made to the userApps should provide a// communicated functionality Apps should not confuse users.
· Apps should be clear about the functionality and objectives. · Explicitly and clearly explain to the user what system changes will be made by the app. Allow users to review and
approve all significant installation options and changes. · Software should not misrepresent the state of the user's device to the user, for example by claiming the system is in a
critical security state or infected with viruses. · Don't utilize invalid activity designed to increase ad traffic and/or conversions. · We don't allow apps that mislead users by impersonating someone else (e.g. another developer, company, entity) or
another app. Don't imply that your app is related to or authorized by someone that it isn' t.

· Don't show ads that are displayed to users in unexpected ways including impairing or interfering with the usability of device functions, or displaying outside the triggering app's environment without being easily dismissable and adequate consent and attribution.
· Apps should not interfere with other apps or the usability of the device · Uninstall, where applicable, should be clear.
· Mobile software should not mimic prompts from the device OS or other apps. Do not suppress alerts to the user from other apps or from the operating system, notably those which inform the user of changes to their OS.

Example violations:

· Disruptive ads · Unauthorized Use or Imitation of System Functionality

Ad Fraud
Ad fraud is strictly prohibited. Ad interactions generated for the purpose of tricking an ad network into believing traffic is from authentic user interest is ad fraud, which is a form of invalid traffic. Ad fraud may be the byproduct of developers implementing ads in disallowed ways, such as showing hidden ads, automatically clicking ads, altering or modifying information and otherwise leveraging non-human actions(spiders, bots, etc.) or human activity designed to produce invalid ad traffic. Invalid traffic and ad fraud is harmful to advertisers, developers, and users, and leads to long-term loss of trust in the mobile Ads ecosystem..
Here are some examples of common violations:
· An app that renders ads that are not visible to the user.
· An app that automatically generates clicks on ads without the user's intention or that produces equivalent network traffic to fraudulently give click credits.
· An app sending fake installation attribution clicks to get paid for installations that did not originate from the sender's network.
· An app that pops up ads when the user is not within the app interface. · False representations of the ad inventory by an app, e.g. an app that communicates to ad networks that it is running on
an iOS device when it is in fact running on an Android device; an app that misrepresents the package name that is being monetized.

Unauthorized Use or Imitation of System Functionality
We don't allow apps or ads that mimic or interfere with system functionality, such as notifications or warnings. System level notifications may only be used for an app's integral features, such as an airline app that notifies users of special deals, or a game that notifies users of in-game promotions.

· Items (such as virtual currencies, extra lives, additional playtime, add-on items, characters and avatar)s;
· subscription services (such as fitness, game, dating, education, music, video, and other content subscription services);

· app functionality or content(such as an ad-free version of an app or new features not available in the free version); and

· cloud software and services (such as data storage services, business productivity software, and financial

management software).

b. Google Play's billing system must not be used in cases where: · payment is primarily:
Note: In some markets, we offer Google Pay for apps selling physical goods and/or services. For more information, please visit our Google Pay developer page.
· for the purchase or rental of physical goods(such as groceries, clothing, housewares, electronics); · for the purchase of physical services (such as transportation services, cleaning services, airfare, gym
memberships, food delivery, tickets for live events); or
· a remittance in respect of a credit card bill or utility bil(lsuch as cable and telecommunications services);
· payments include peer-to-peer payments, online auctions, and tax exempt donations;
· payment is for content or services that facilitate online gambling, as described in the Gambling Apps section of the Real-Money~am ltngd'ames~ ndContests policy
· payment is in respect of any product category deemed unacceptable under Google'sPayments Center Content Policies.

3. Apps other than those described in 2(b) may not lead users to a payment method other than Google Play's billing system. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, leading users to other payment methods via:
· An app's listing in Google Play; · In-app promotions related to purchasable content; · In-app webviews, buttons, links, messaging, advertisements or other calls to action; and · In-app user interface flows, including account creation or sign-up flows, that lead users from an app to a payment
method other than Google Play's billing system as part of those flows.
4. In-app virtual currencies must only be used within the app or game title for which they were purchased.

5. Developers must clearly and accurately inform users about the terms and pricing of their app or any in-app features or subscriptions offered for purchase. In-app pricing must match the pricing displayed in the user-facing Play billing interface. If your product description on Google Play refers to in-app features that may require a specific or additional charge, your app listing must clearly notify users that payment is required to access those features.

6. Apps and games offering mechanisms to receive randomized virtual items from a purchase including, but not limited to, "loot boxes" must clearly disclose the odds of receiving those items in advance of, and in close and timely proximity to, that purchase.

Subscriptions
You, as a developer, must not mislead users about any subscription services or content you offer within your app. It is critical to communicate clearly in any in-app promotions or splash screens.
In your app:You must be transparent about your offer. This includes being explicit about your offer terms, the cost of your subscription, the frequency of your billing cycle, and whether a subscription is required to use the app. Users should not have to perform any additional action to review the information.
Hereare some examples of commonviolations:

· Monthly subscriptions that do not inform users they will be automatically renewed and charged every month. · Annual subscriptions that most prominently display their pricing in terms of monthly cost. · Subscription pricing and terms that are incompletely localized. · In-app promotions that do not clearly demonstrate that a user can access content without a subscription(when
available). · SKU names that do not accurately convey the nature of the subscription, such as "Free Trial" for a subscription with an
auto-recurring charge.

Lockscreen Monetization
Unless the exclusive purpose of the app is that of a lockscreen, apps may not introduce ads or features that monetize the locked display of a device.
Disruptive Ads
Disruptive ads are ads that are displayed to users in unexpected ways, that may result in inadvertent clicks, or impairing or interfering with the usability of device functions. Your app cannot force a user to click an ad or submit personal information for advertising purposes before they can fully use an app. Interstitial ads may only be displayed inside of the app serving them.

The advertising identifier may only be connected to personallyidentifiable information with the explicit consent of the user. · Analytics use: The advertising identifier may only be connected to personally-identifiable information or associated with any persistent device identifier(for example: SSAID, MAC address, IMEI, etc.) with the explicit consent of the user.
· Respecting users' selections. If reset, a new advertising identifier must not be connected to a previous advertising identifier or data derived from a previous advertising identifier without the explicit consent of the user. Also, you must abide by a user's "Opt out of Interest-based Advertising" or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting. If a user has enabled this setting, you may not use the advertising identifier for creating user profiles for advertising purposes or for targeting users with personalized advertising.

Families Ads Program
If you serve ads in your app, and the target audience for your app only includes children as described in the Families Policy, then you must use ad SDKs that have self-certified compliance with Google Play policies, including the Ad SDK certification requirements below. If the target audience for your app includes both children and older users, you must implement age screening measures and make sure that ads shown to children come exclusively from one of these selfcertified ad SDKs. Apps in the Designed for Families program are required to only use self-certified ad SDKs.
The use of Google Play certified ad SDKs is only required if you are using ad SDKs to serve ads to children. The following are permitted without an ad SDK's self-certification with Google Play, however, you are still responsible for ensuring your ad content and data collection practices are compliant with Play's User Data Policy and Families Policy:

Such treatment must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as the US Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR). Google Play requires ad SDKs to disable personalized ads, interest based advertising, and remarketing as part of the child-directed treatment.

Note: Ad SDKs must support ad serving that complies with all relevant statutes and regulations concerning children that may apply to their publishers.

Mediation requirements for serving platforms when serving ads to children:
· Only use Play certified ad SDKs or implement safeguards necessary to ensure that all ads served from mediation comply with these requirements; and
· Pass information necessary to mediation platforms to indicate the ad content rating and any applicable child-directed treatment.

Developers can find a list of self-certified ad SDKs here.

Also, developers can share this interest form with ad SDKs who wish to become self-certified.

Store Listing and Promotion
The promotion and visibility of your app dramatically affects store quality. Avoid spammy store listings, low quality promotion, and efforts to artificially boost app visibility on Google Play.

App Promotion
We don't allow apps that directly or indirectly engage in or benefit from promotion practices that are deceptive or harmful to users or the developer ecosystem. This includes apps that engage in the following behavior:
· Using deceptive ads on websites, apps, or other properties, including notifications that are similar to system notifications and alerts.
· Promotion or installation tactics that redirect users to Google Play or download apps without informed user action. · Unsolicited promotion via SMS services.
It is your responsibility to ensure that any ad networks or affiliates associated with your app comply with these policies and do not employ any prohibited promotion practices.

Content Ratings
Content ratings on Google Play are provided by the International Age Rating Coalition(IARC) and are designed to help developers communicate locally relevant content ratings to users. Regional IARC authorities maintain guidelines which are used to determine the maturity level of the content in an app. We don't allow apps without a content rating on Google Play.
How content ratings are used
Content ratings are used to inform consumers, especially parents, of potentially objectionable content that exists within an app. They also help filter or block your content in certain territories or to specific users where required by law, and determine your app's eligibility for special developer programs.
How content ratings are assigned
To receive a content rating, you must fill out a rating questionnaire on the Play Console that asks about the nature of your apps' content. Your app will be assigned a content rating from multiple rating authorities based on your questionnaire responses. Misrepresentation of your app's content may result in removal or suspension, so it is important to provide accurate responses to the content rating questionnaire. To prevent your app from being listed as "Unrated", you must complete the content rating questionnaire for each new app submitted to the Play Console, as well as for all existing apps that are active on Google Play. If you make changes to your app content or features that affect the responses to the rating questionnaire, you must submit a new content rating questionnaire in the Play Console. Visit the Help Center to find more information on the different rating authorities and how to complete the content rating questionnaire.
Rating appeals
If you do not agree with the rating assigned to your app, you can appeal directly to the IARC rating authority using the link provided in your certificate email.
News
An app that declares itself as a "News" app on Google Play must meet all of the following requirements. News apps that require a user to purchase a membership must provide a content preview for users prior to purchase. News apps MUST: · provide ownership information about the news publisher and its contributors including, but not limited to, the official
website for the news published in your app, valid and verifiable contact information, and the original publisher of each article, and · have a website or in-app page that provides valid contact information for the news publisher. News apps MUST NOT: · contain significant spelling 8 or grammatical errors, · contain only static content(e.g., content that is several months old), and · have affiliate marketing or ad revenue as its primary purpose. News apps that aggregate content from different publishing sources must be transparent about the publishing source of the content in the app and each of the sources must meet News policy requirements.
Spam and Minimum Functionality
At a minimum, apps should provide users with a basic degree of functionality and a respectful user experience. Apps that crash, exhibit other behavior that is not consistent with a functional user experience, or that serve only to spam users or Google Play are not apps that expand the catalog in a meaningful way.

Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) - Play Console Help

Message Spam
We don't allow apps that send SMS, email, or other messages on behalf of the user without giving the user the ability to confirm the content and intended recipients.

Webviews and Affiliate Spam
We don't allow apps whose primary purpose is to drive affiliate traffic to a website or provide a webview of a website without permission from the website owner or administrator.

Repetitive Content
We don't allow apps that merely provide the same experience as other apps already on Google Play. Apps should provide value to users through the creation of unique content or services.
Here are some examples of common violations:
· Copying content from other apps without adding any original content or value. · Creating multiple apps with highly similar functionality, content, and user experience. If these apps are each small in
content volume, developers should consider creating a single app that aggregates all the content.

We don't allow apps that crash, force close, freeze, or otherwise function abnormally. Here are some examples of common violations: · Apps that don't install · Apps that install, but don't load · Apps that load, but are not responsive
Other Programs
In addition to compliance with the content policies set out elsewhere in this Policy Center, apps that are designed for other Android experiences and distributed via Google Play may also be subject to program-specific policy requirements. Be sure to review the list below to determine if any of these policies apply to your app.

Android Instant Apps
Our goal with Android Instant Apps is to create delightful, frictionless user experiences while also adhering to the highest standards of privacy and security. Our policies are designed to support that goal. Developers choosing to distribute Android Instant Apps through Google Play must adhere to the following policies, in addition to all other Google Play Developer Program Policies.
Identity
For instant apps that include login functionality, developers must integrate Smart Lock for Passwords.
Link Support
Android Instant Apps developers are required to properly support links for other apps. If the developer's instant app or installed app contains links that have the potential to resolve to an instant app, the developer must send users to that instant app, rather than, for example, capturing the links in a WebView.
Technical Specifications
Developers must comply with the Android Instant Apps technical specifications and requirements provided by Google, as may be amended from time to time, including those listed in our public documentation.

Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) - Play Console Help

The instant app may offer the user the installable app, but this must not be the instant app's primary purpose. When

offering installation, developers must:

· Use the Material Design "get app" icon and the label "install" for the installation button. · Not have more than 2-3 implicit installation prompts in their instant app. · Not use a banner or other ad-like technique for presenting an installation prompt to users.

Additional instant app details and UX guidelines can be found in the Best Practices for User Experience.

Changing Device State
Instant apps must not make changes to the user's device that persist longer than the instant app session. For example, instant apps may not change the user's wallpaper or create a homescreen widget.

App Visibility
Developers must ensure that instant apps are visible to the user, such that the user is aware at all times that the instant app is running on their device.

Device Identifiers
Instant apps are prohibited from accessing device identifiers that both(1) persist after the instant app stops running and (2) are not resettable by the user. Examples include, but are not limited to:
· Build Serial · M ac Addressesof anynetworkingchips · IMEI, IMSI
Instant apps may access phone number if obtained using the runtime permission. The developer must not attempt to fingerprint the user using these identifiers or any other means.

Network traffic
Network traffic from inside the instant app must be encrypted using a TLS protocol like HTTPS.

Families
Google Play offers a rich platform for developers to showcase their high-quality, age appropriate content for the whole family. Before submitting an app to the Designed for Families program or submitting an app that targets children to the Google Play Store, you are responsible for ensuring your app is appropriate for children and compliant with all relevant laws.
Learn about the families process and review the interactive checklist at Academy for App Success.

Designing Apps for Children and Families
The use of technology as a tool for enriching families' lives continues to grow, and parents are looking for safe, highquality content to share with their children. You may be designing your apps specifically for children or your app may just attract their attention. Google Play wants to help you make sure your app is safe for all users, including families.
The word "children" can mean different things in different locales and in different contexts. It is important that you consult with your legal counsel to help determine what obligations and/or age-based restrictions may apply to your app. You know best how your app works so we are relying on you to help us make sure apps on Google Play are safe for families.
Apps designed specifically for children must participate in the Designed for Families program. If your app targets both children and older audiences, you may still participate in the Designed for Families program. All apps that opt in to the Designed for Families program will be eligible to be rated for the Teacher Approved program but we cannot guarantee that your app will be included in the Teacher Approved program. If you decide not to participate in the Designed for Families program, you still must comply with the Google Play Families Policy requirements below, as well as all other Google Play Developer Program Policies and the Developer Distribution Agreement.
Play Console Requirements
Target Audience and Content
In the Target Audience and Content section of the Google Play Console you must indicate the target audience for your app, prior to publishing, by selecting from the list of age groups provided. Regardless of what you identify in the Google

2/1 4/2021

Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) - Play Console Help

Play Console, if you choose to include imagery and terminology in your app that could be considered targeting children,

this may impact Google Play's assessment of your declared target audience. Google Play reserves the right to conduct its

own review of the app information that you provide to determine whether the target audience that you disclose is

accurate.

If you select a target audience that only includes adults, but Google determines that this is inaccurate because your app is targeting both children and adults, you will have the option to make clear to users that your app is not targeting children by agreeing to carry a warning label.

You should only select more than one age group for your app's target audience if you have designed your app for and ensured that your app is appropriate for users within the selected age group. For example, apps designed for babies, toddlers, and preschool children should only have the age group "Ages 5 & Under" selected as the age group target for those apps. If your app is designed for a specific level of school, choose the age group that best represents that school level. You should only select age groups that include both adults and children if you truly have designed your app for all ages.

Updates to Target Audience and Content Section

You can always update your app's information in the Target Audience and Content section in the Google Play Console. An app update is required before this information will be reflected on the Google Play store. However, any changes you make in this section of the Google Play Console may be reviewed for policy compliance even before an app update is submitted.

We strongly recommend that you let your existing users know if you change the target age group for your app or start using ads or in-app purchases, either by using the "What's New" section of your app's store listing page or through in-app notifications.

Misrepresentation in Play Console

Misrepresentation of any information about your app in the Play Console, including in the Target Audience and Content section, may result in removal or suspension of your app, so it is important to provide accurate information.

Families Policy Requirements
If one of the target audiences for your app is children, you must comply with the following requirements. Failure to satisfy these requirements may result in app removal or suspension.
1. App content: Your app's content that is accessible to children must be appropriate for children.
2. Google Play Console Answers: You must accurately answer the questions in the Google Play Console regarding your app and update those answers to accurately reflect any changes to your app.
3. Ads: If your app displays ads to children or to users of unknown age, you must: · only use Google Play certified ad SDKs to display ads to those users; · ensure ads displayed to those users do not involve interest-based advertising(advertising targeted at individual users who have certain characteristics based on their online browsing behavio)r or remarketing (advertising
targeted at individual users based on previous interaction with an app or website);
· ensure ads displayed to those users present content that is appropriate for children;
· ensure ads displayed to those users follow the Families ad format requirements; and · ensure compliance with all applicable legal regulations and industry standards relating to advertising to children.
4. Data Collection: You must disclose the collection of any personal and sensitive Information from children in your app, including through APls and SDKs called or used in your app. Sensitive information from children includes, but is not limited to, authentication information, microphone and camera sensor data, device data, Android ID, ad usage data, and advertising ID.
5. APls and SDKs: You must ensure that your app properly implements any APls and SDKs. · Apps that solely target children must not contain any APls or SDKs that are not approved for use in child-directed services. This includes, Google Sign-In(or any other Google API Service that accesses data associated with a Google Account), Google Play Games Services, and any other API Service using OAuth technology for authentication and authorization. · Apps that target both children and older audiences must not implement APls or SDKs that are not approved for use in child-directed services unless they are used behind a neutral age screen or implemented in a way that does not result in the collection of data from children(e.g., providing Google Sign-in as an optional feature). Apps that target both children and older audiences must not require users to sign-in or access app content through an API or SDK that is not approved for use in child-directed services.
6. Privacy policy: You must provide a link to your app's privacy policy on your app's store listing page. This link must be maintained at all times while the app is available on the Store, and it must link to a privacy policy that, among other things, accurately describes your app's data collection and use.
7. Special restrictions:

All advertising, offers for inapp purchase, and commercial content in these apps must comply with all applicable laws and regulations(including any
relevant self-regulatory or industry guidelines).
Google Play reserves the right to reject, remove or suspend apps for overly aggressive commercial tactics.
Ad format requirements

Here are some examples of inappropriate ad content that should not be displayed to children. · Inappropriate Media Content: Ads for TV shows, movies, music albums, or any other media outlet that are not
appropriate for children. · Inappropriate Video Games & Downloadable Software: Ads for downloadable software and electronic video games

Ad SDKs If you serve ads in your app and your target audience only includes children, then you must use Google Play certified ad SDKs. If the target audience for your app includes both children and older users, you must implement age screening measures, such as a neutral age screen, and make sure that ads shown to children come exclusively from Google Play certified ad SDKs. Apps in the Designed for Families program are required to only use self-certified ad SDKs. Please refer to the Families Ads Program policy page for more details on these requirements and to see the current list of approved ad SDKs. If you use AdMob, refer to the AdMob Help Center for more details on their products. It is your responsibility to ensure your app satisfies all requirements concerning advertisements, in-app purchases, and commercial content. Contact your ad SDK provider to learn more about their content policies and advertising practices. In-app purchases Google Play will re-authenticate all users prior to any in-app purchases in apps participating in the Designed for Families program. This measure is to help ensure that the financially responsible party, and not children, are approving purchases.
Enforcement
Avoiding a policy violation is always better than managing one, but when violations do occur, we' re committed to ensuring developers understand how they can bring their app into compliance. Please let us know if you see any violations or have any questions about managing a violation.
Policy Coverage
Our policies apply to any content your app displays or links to, including any ads it shows to users and any user-generated content it hosts or links to. Further, they apply to any content from your developer account which is publicly displayed in Google Play, including your developer name and the landing page of your listed developer website.

Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) - Play Console Help

We don't allow apps that let users install other apps to their devices. Apps that provide access to other apps, games, or

software without installation, including features and experiences provided by third parties, must ensure that all the

content they provide access to adheres to all Google Play policies and may also be subject to additional policy reviews.

Defined terms used in these policies have the same meaning as in the Developer Distribution Agreement(DDA). In addition to complying with these policies and the DDA, the content of your app must be rated in accordance with our Content Rating Guidelines.

We don't allow apps or app content that undermine user trust in the Google Play ecosystem. In assessing whether to include or remove apps from Google Play, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, a pattern of harmful behavior or high risk of abuse. We identify risk of abuse including, but not limited to, items such as app- and developer-specific complaints, news reporting, previous violation history, user feedback, and use of popular brands, characters, and other assets.

How Google Play Protect works
Google Play Protect checks apps when you install them. It also periodically scans your device. If it finds a potentially harmful app, it might:
· Send you a notification. To remove the app, tap the notification, then tap Uninstall. · Disable the app until you uninstall it. · Remove the app automatically. In most cases, if a harmful app has been detected, you will get a notification saying that
the app was removed.
How malware protection works To protect you against malicious third-party software, URLs and other security issues, Google may receive information about:
· Your device's network connections · Potentially harmful URLs · Operating system, and apps installed on your device through Google Play or other sources.
You may get a warning from Google about an app or URL thatmaybe unsafe. The app or URL may be removed or blocked from installation by Google if it is known to be harmful to devices, data or users.
You can choose to disable some of these protections in your device settings. But Google may continue to receive information about apps installed through Google Play, and apps installed on your device from other sources may continue to be checked for security issues without sending information to Google.
How Privacy alerts work Google Play Protect will alert you if an app is removed from the Google Play Store because the app may access your personal information and you' ll have an option to uninstall the app.

Enforcement Process
If your app violates any of our policies, we' ll take appropriate action as outlined below. In addition, we' ll provide you with relevant information about the action we' ve taken via email along with instructions on how to appeal if you believe we' ve taken action in error.
Please note that removal or administrative notices may not indicate each and every policy violation present in your app or broader app catalog. Developers are responsible for addressing any policy issue and conducting extra due diligence to ensure that the remainder of their app is fully policy compliant. Failure to address policy violations in all of your apps may result in additional enforcement actions.
Repeated or serious violations(such as malware, fraud, and apps that may cause user or device harm) of these policies or the Developer Distribution Agreement(DDA) will result in termination of individual or related Google Play Developer accounts.

Enforcement Actions
Different enforcement actions can impact your app in different ways. The following section describes the vadious actions Google Play may take, and the impact to your app and / or your Google Play Developer account. This information is also explained in this video.
