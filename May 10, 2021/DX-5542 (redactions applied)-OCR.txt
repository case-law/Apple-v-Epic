I updated with some more fresh content. My initial concern: I know Apple can keep secrets, I'm not as sure
about Google. So I think we should watermark each slide when we do the Zoom, and then not leave the deck behind IMO.

On it. And totally agree on the deck. I just started reassembling it. It can be as lean as we'd like. Hans

Possible to move the meeting to next week? I'd like to attend but cannot make the Friday time. Will go through the deck and add comments - we should sanitize this a bit tnore I think than the Apple @BR deck.

Hey Matt / Nate,

Google has scheduled a meeting this Friday at 12:30pm ET to talk through greater marketing opportunities with Epic Games, especially as they relate to big beats within Fortnite including new Season launches. If all is successful, we should be able to get ahead of the Marvel launch and acquire full marketing support. If project Liberty doesn't afFect our position and relationship, of course.
That being said,

1. Do you snll want me to keep the meeting' ?

2. If yes, are you comfortable with fne sharing our upcoming Fortnite roadmap?

3. If yes, is there anything you'd prefer not to include here? We can condense it down as much as you would like. Or retool. Still an active WIP.

If either of you would also like to attend, by all tneans, that would be awesome. But totally get your calendars are insane.
Hans
