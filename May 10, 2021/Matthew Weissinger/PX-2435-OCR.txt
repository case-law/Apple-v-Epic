For context, the placement he is talking about is a complete takeover of the App Store games tab. This means all 8 tiles in the carousel in the games tab would be dedicated to Fortnite on the App Store and a Today Tab story placement for two weeks. This has only been done for Supercell on the launch of Clash Royale and a smaller version for Brawl Stars.
The group on this thread has met a few times and have elected to turn down this placement opportunity because of the risk of leaking an asset is high and would negatively iinpact the Chapter 2 release. Apple had originally requested the assets by the 10th, and then as recent as yesterday were willing to accept them the day before release.
We reiterated that we would love the placement, but can only provide the art on the day of release like we will with all platforms.
Today Mike S and Mark G notified us they would be escalating to you and here we are. I wanted to make sure you had the back story.
Thanks.

We have some significant and unprecedented support planned for the Fortnite Season 2 launch and in order to achieve that, based on the way our editorial system works, we need assets in advance to make this happen on

day of launch.
Whether or not we are the biggest platform by active users, we have 500M visitors hit the App Store on a weekly basis. A signiticant number of those visitors have other platforms in which to play Fortnite, so this is not simply about driving installs. It's an incredible reach. I want to make sure Fortnite is plastered all over the Games Tab and has significant coverage on our Today Tab as well as social the MOMENT that Chapter 2 hits.
If you can secure us early access to these assets, I will take personal responsibility for them and limit the exposure to the absolute minimum amount of folks needed to cut and prepare them for launch; likely one editor and one designer. I know we' ve had issues in the past with a significant art leak but I' ll remain extremely close to this and can assure you that will not happen. Those involved know what it would mean to this relationship.
Pleaselet me know if you thinkthis is possible. I'm happy to hop on the phone to discuss further if you' d prefer.
Best,
