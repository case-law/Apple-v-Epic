Press and Player Sentiment if the Game is Blocked
In this scenario, players on Apple/Boogie are blocked from the app. Examples of pro-Epic messaging will be: a Ep i c Fights for the Players and DeveloperEs;pic's battle against store monopolies means greater savings for players via Epic Direct Payment and greater rewards for developers with the Epic Games Store. · Th eApp Store, Google Play and Steam are Anti-Consumer MonopoliesE: pic has proven that a better model exists that removes the middle man and creates a more fair ecosystem for players and developers. I Sav i ng Money is GoodE:pic's actions have a clear player benefit. Google and Apple's stance does not.
Examples of anti-Epic messaging will be:
think the 're s ecial'2 a Ep i c is GreedyS:ome players will think that Epic only seeks to profit off of Epic Direct Payment, Why else would we be implementing a new
payment systemsWh does E icneed more mone ? · Pla y ers are Pawns in Epic's BattlesA:ny new negative consequences for players (e.g. no longer able to play,.or additional friction in their
experience) will be seen as Epic's fault for pushing this cause and they were given no choice in the matter. · App l e/Google Own the Platform"W: e welcome any developer that recognizes the value of Google Play and expect them to participate
under thesame terms as other developers."(Google's December 2019 response to press)
