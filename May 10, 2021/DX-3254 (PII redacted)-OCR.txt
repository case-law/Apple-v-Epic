And to be 100% clear, we are talking about removing the replay tab, not replay recording.

Did we verify the sequence will actually play under those conditions in replay?

Yes, that was a prerequisite for turning back on Replays after we disabled them on Wednesday. QA tested
going to the Pleasant using a cun ent replay made in 7.30.1, and also going to Pleasant using the 7.30.1 client with a replay created in 7.30.0. In both cases they could not hear the audio on console.

Should we just pre-emptively disable replay tab from 1 till after concert? Minimal player impact and removes a big attack vector.

I don't know of a particular reason to do so Currently, but your Minimal player i nrpaci Ssnd remolds a bi g armck vecror statement sounds very appealing. We should probably just disable replays at Ipm.

I understand the video being leaked at that time, but why do we expect the sequence to be leaked? If we do we should disable replays from 1 PM till after the concert.

Timing and expectations update:

The concert goes live at 2 p.m. With the latest MCP, regular clients will decrypt the content at I:30 p.m. Which I believe corresponds with the enabling of the LTM. They may be able to view the concert video replays at that time. Intrepid leakers may leak the background video as early as 11:30 a.m. All of
this is expected, so we probably don't need a shit happens for it but inight be worth posting in the 퉠h01-30-marshleak02 channel just so we know if people see stuff.

Minor nuance - but not when 7.30.1 is live but rather when 7.30,1 is forced require for iOS if it lags behind. Aka, replay tab should remain hotfixed off fill then, right?

Last Update:  We have been unable to reproduce this issue on the 7.30.1 client build we should
consider this particular leak resolved once this build goes live.

Other Callouts

 We do think there is some risk that players inight be able to extract content (specifically
the MP4) via Switch but can't definitively say if it is possible or not.  Adjusting to distribute encryption key 2-3 hours before the concert (original plan was 6
hours before)  Meeting next week to discuss "event best practices" and encryption on consoles so we
can avoid similar leaks in the future

Thanks everyone, Dom

For the current encryption pak files we generate, we split out the asset registry entries for the
items within and store them inside the encrypted pak. When the key is delivered, we mount that pak and register those new items with the asset manager. We just need to make that part of it work within the exisfing console data scheme and we'd get the effect we want. There' d
needto besome token decryption ofgsomething*,justto make sure nobody spoofsabogus
key, but that would only be small and have no performance considerations. Having said that, the festivus movie wouldn't have been helped by that because it's not an engine asset and isn't referenced by the asset manager at all. We'd need to encrypt some proxy
objectfurther up the chain (and deal with the inissing reference problems that would cause),
or have some bespoke means of restricting access to files in the pak at a lower level (as Ben mentioned above). In the future, movies could be wrapped in their own asset type and then they'd fit within the scheme described above naturally.

I'm not overly worried about performance if we approach this sensibly, We don't need full
asset encryption on consoles to solve this - the filesystems are already encrypted so decrypting the twice would be overkill.

We just need to prevent consoles from loading protected assets. We can achieve that by simpler means, e.g just by encrypting pak indices for selected assets. We' ll discuss options with the Core team, but this should be achievable without encrypting evetything twice.

While not used in this leak (yet?), replays run fully on the client so even though the BP code triggering the sequence is wrapped in "is server", it in theory should be

Encryption doesn't necessarily solve everything while our grace period for delivering key is 6 hours before the event. We need to investigate reducing that. RMW, had this been found a few days later the entire concert would have most likely leaked as the stage would have been loaded. -- Daniel, Epic Games Inc.

 Current theory is that this is a console specific issue o Video was shipped un-encrypted on those platforms as the are considered secure
 Talking through options to prevent this moving forward
 Assumption is that once the stage is complete the at least the video would also play using this method.

I will follow up again once we have a clear path forward.

What happened to our plans to encrypt content? Can we not put relevant content into asset packages and encrypt them together with music?

All of these events will be ruined by leaks if we don't get this tech together.
