We believe that every app developer is entitled to fair treatment and that every consumer should have complete control over their own device. Our App Store Principleswill ensure a level playing field for platforms like Apple and a consistent standard of conduct across the app ecosystem. The 10 principles outlined include that every developer should always have the right to communicate directly with its users through its app for legitimate business purposes and that no app store should charge unreasonable or excessive fees.

issues

Apple uses its control of the iQS operating system to favor itself by controlling the products and features that are available to consumers. The company requires equipment manufacturers to limit options, forces developers to sell through its App Store, and even steals ideas from competitors.

30% "App Tax" on Creators & Consumers
For most purchases made within the App Store, Apple takes 30% of the purchase price. No other transaction fee -- in any industry -- comes close. This app tax cuts deeply into consumer purchasing power and developer revenue. This app tax is especially unfair when it is imposed on apps that compete directly with those sold by Apple, driving up their prices and puttinq them at a distinct competitive disadvantage.

Op No Consumer Freedom 0 If consumers want to use a modern mobile device, Apple levies a tax that no one can avoid. No competition, no options, no recourse. The Apple App Store policies are prisons that consumers are required to pay for and that developers cannot escape.

about the

CQQIii'gTiQQ · O~ ·

One company has near total control over the mobile ecosystem and what apps consumers get to use. After nearly a decade with no oversight,

regulation, or fair competition, it's time for Apple to be held accountable.

The Coalition for App Fairness was created to create a level playing field for app businesses and give people freedom of choice on their devices. Our members want every app developer to have an equal opportunity to innovate and engage in commerce, free from draconian policies, unfair taxes, or monopolistic control. In the past, individual companies have spoken out against the App Store policies through efforts like Spotify's Time to Play Fair and Epic Games' ¹FreeFortnite campaign. Today, these companies and many others are joining forces to speak as one.

The Coalition represents all innovators -- from startups to small developers to indie studios to first time creators. Have your voice heard byjoining the coalition today.
