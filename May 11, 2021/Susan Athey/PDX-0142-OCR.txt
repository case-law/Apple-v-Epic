Assignment
Analyze whether Apple's conduct affects the competition faced by Apple'ssmartphone operating system platform. Consider how middleware affects competition between mobile platforms and if Apple's conduct impedes the development of middleware.

Summary of Opinions
Switching and mixing-and-matching costs lock users into the iOS ecosystem. Middleware can meaningfully reduce costs for users and developers. Apple's restrictions block users and developers f'rom using middleware, which allows Apple to retain market power over users and developers.

Cross-platform stores operate across multiple platforms,
and therefore allow users to migrate and synchronize their apps on all of
those platforms.
This, in turn, reduces their switching and mixing-and-matching costs.
