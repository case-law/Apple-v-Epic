V3/Final Question Q16 of Professor Rossi's Survey

Recall this situation:
Imagine that, starting 30 days ago, the Apple AppStore increased the prices of all IAPs/subscriptions by 5%.
You toldus that yciur spending on IAPs(5ubscriptiorisduring (he past 30 days was %4.04. The higher prices mean that the same purchaseswould have instead cost you $4.24.
Nothing else about apps or IAPs/subscriptions has changed. Pricesat other app stores (e.g. the Google Play store) or websites remain the same.

Thinking about the same 30-day period. would you have made the same purchases of IAPslsubscriptionsfrom the Apple App Store with the higher prices?
