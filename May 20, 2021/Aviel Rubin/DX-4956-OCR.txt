Ransomware is a form of malicious software that

threatens you with harm, usually by denying you

access to your data. Ransomware attacks are often deployed via social engineering tacitics. Once a user falls victim to the attack, their data is encrpyted. The

stj 

attacker then demands a ransom from the victim, with the promise to restore access to the data upon payment.
Ransomware attacks worldwide rose 86o% in zo18. Ransomware attacks are estimated to cost $6 trillion annually by zozz.

Ransomware attacks worldwide rose

Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of someone else's computer to mine cryptocurrency.
