Threat inteigence Report 2020

Covid-19 caused a surge in mobile malware infections.
In 2020, the average monthly infection rate in mobile networks was 0.23%. In February and March, however, the monthly mobile infection rate increased by almost 30% over the previous months, largely due to the significant escalation of cyber security incidents related to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The impact of Covid-19 was felt later in fixed broadband.
For fixed broadband networks, the average monthly infection rate per residence was 2.16%. While this is down overall compared to 2019, there was a sharp increase in infection rates in May and Junedue to the Covid-19 pandemic -- but this spike happened two months after the one observed in mobile networks.
Infections have lncl eased significantly in the lo T space.
loT devices are now responsible for 32.72% of all infections observed in mobile networks, up from 16.17% in 2019. This trend lines up with the growing number of IoT devices that are now connected to mobile networks. Nokia's Threat Intelligence Lab anticipated this trend and has monitored the situation closely throughout the year.

Android devices are the most common malware targets.
Android devices are responsible for 26.64. /o of infections across all platforms, but this is down from 4.7.1 5 /o in 2019. While this change is due in part to improved security in Android device, it is mostly the result of the increase in loTrelated infections.
PCs leadthe way in infections.
Windows/PCs are responsible for 38.92% of all infections, up slightly from 35.82% in 2019.
Info-stealers and spywal e
ale on the I lse.
There is a strong trend toward info-stealers and mobile spyware, which make up 35.76'/o of all Android infections.
Trojans are now the malware of choice.
The share of malware detected as Trojans jumped to 74.% from just 34% in 2019, largely because the exceptional circumstance of this year havemade phishing campaigns the best way to delivery malware directly to users. The relative share of worms and viruses has decreased in 2020.

The Covid-19 pandemic has wide social and economic implications in countries around the globe. As expected, cybercriminals are playing on people's fears and are seeing this situation as an opportunity to promote their agendas.
Nokia's Threat Intelligence Lab is monitoring the situation and providing actionable threat intelligence to detect Covid-19 malware variants as well as established malware delivered through Coronavirus-related phishing campaigns.
Covid-19 specihc malware Some of the malware observed in mobile and fixed networks has been created specifically for the occasion. They were mostly created hastily and are not very sophisticated, but are nonethelesseffective,as users became more susceptibleto the tricks used by the attackers
CoViper CoViper is a new wiper malware family taking advantage of the Covid-19 crisis. It attracts victims by masquerading as a file related to the coronavirus. The wiper breaks an infected computer's boot operation by rewriting the Master Boot Record (MBR) located on the computer's disk.

"Coronavirus Maps" Trojan A malware disguised as a "Coronavirus Map" is targeting the Windows platform. It takes advantage of the public's demand for accurate information about new Covid-19 infections, deaths and transmissions.
The "Coronavirus Map" application is used to plant malware on victims' computers. This malware masquerades asa software from Johns Hopkins University and mimics the university's real map.
COVIDLock Android Ransomware This Android app is a Trojan that claims to track the coronavirus spread across the globe and more specifically known Covid-19 patients in the immediate vicinity. In reality, the app is a ransompay a ransom in order to unlock the device.
Due to a phishing email or Google search, the user is drawn to a malicious web site that looks like a legitimate Covid-19 information site. They are encouraged to install an application that will provide real-time updates. This is actually a ransomware app that locks their phone.

COVID-19 themed phishingattacks delivering various malwares In addition to malware that was specifically created or modified to fit the Covid-19 theme, some phishing campaigns are tailored to this theme but are delivering existing malware. Below is a list of observed phishing campaigns that exploit the sense of urgency around Covid-19.
Remcos RAT Remcos is a sophisticated remote access Trojan (RAT) that can be used to fully control and monitor any Windows computer from XP onwards. It is widely used in multiple malicious campaigns by threat actors.
The latest campaign utilizes social engineering technique wherein threat actors are leveraging what's new and trending worldwide. The phishing email contains a PDF offering coronavirus safety measures, but in reality this PDF includes executable for a RElvlCOS RAT dropper that runs together with a VBS file executing the malware.
As illustrated in Figure 1, versions of the malware that were used in previous campaigns are reused in the Covid-19 campaigns. For this particular version of the malware, Win32.Backdoor.Remcosrat.A,the peak was reached at the end of the year, but it got a new life as it was reused in the COVID-19 campaign inJuly 2020.

Plugx deliveredby Covid-19 themed documents PlugX a malicious program that targets the Windows platform. This malware is usually distributed through phishing emails, infected websites and malicious software. Its primary goal is to drop malicious payload. After the malware has established persistence on a system, it tries to establish a network connection with the Command and Control server.
PlugX sends sensitive information of the device to the CH,C server, deletes or changes registry entries and changes plugins as directed by the C8 C server.

HawkEye info-stealer distributed as fake Covid-19 drug advice A new HawkEye malware variant is being distributed in mails spoofing the World Health Organization. The email appears to be sent directly from Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, DirectorGeneral, World Health Organization (WHO).
HawkEye is a malicious information-stealing malware that targets the Windows operating system. The malware is delivered via spam emails containing malicious URL links or macro embedded files. Once installed, the malware steals sensitive information using the technique of browser keylogging. The malware is also able to download additional malware to the compromised system.

Kimsuky Covid-19 campaign Kimsuky malware is delivered as a Microsoft Word file masquerading as information about the Covid-19 pandemic. The document contains a macro that will execute should the user fall for the request to enable additional content downloads to properly view the document. When opened, the malicious macro connects with Command and Control and tries to retrieve a file from site.

Recommendations Most of the attacks related to COVID-19 are phishing attacks. The attackers are not exploiting new vulnerabilities and, in most cases, are not even creating new malware. What they do is to use the COVID-19 theme in their phishing attacks in order to increase the success rate of the phishing campaign.

Mobile infection rate Figure 2 shows the percentage of infected devices observed monthly since January 2019. This data has been averaged from mobile deployments in Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East.
In 2020 the average percentage of devices infectedeach month was 0.23%. The peak was reached during the months of February and March, when the monthly mobile infection rate increased by almost 30% compared with the previous months. The reason for the increase is the significant escalation of cyber security incidents related to Covid-19. As presented in a previous section, the malicious actors were prompt in exploiting the opportunity offered by the spread of Covid-'I 9.
As Nokia's NetGuard Endpoint Security solution is deployed in the networks of mobile internet service providers (ISPs) around the world, the increase in mobile infections was detected very early. By February, the increase was reflected in the monthly mobile infection rate.
As for the overall infection percentage, it is down from previous years. There are several explanations for this trend:
· Over the last few years, a significant improvement has been seen in the security of official mobile

· The numbers come from networks protected by NetGuard Endpoint Security. This solution provides powerful mechanisms to help mobile ISPs detect and address cyber security issues in their mobile networks. NetGuard Endpoint

Security also facilitates the notification of mobile subscribers of infections affecting their devices, so the subscribers can take actions by themselves. Therefore, as ISPs take action to actively reduce the rate of infection of their
subscribers' devices, the mobile infection rate tends to be reduced over time.

Infections byDevice Figure 3 provides a breakdown of infections by devicetype in 2020. Among smartphones, Android devices are the most commonly targeted by malware. Android devices were responsible for 26.64% of all infections, Windows/PCs for 38.92%, IoT devices for 32.72% and only 1.72% for iPhones.
Comparing with 2019, the share occupied by infected Android devices has decreased, reflecting the shifting interest of the malicious actors toward loT devices. Android-based devices still represent a major target in mobile networks.
In the smartphone sector, the main venue for distributing malware is represented by Trojanized applications. The user is tricked by phishing, advertising or other social engineering into downloading and installing the application. The security of official app stores, such as Google Play Store, has increased continuously. However, the fact that Android applications can be downloaded from just about anywhere still represents a huge problem, as users are free to download apps from third-party app stores, where many of the applications, while functional, are Trojanized. iPhones applications, on the other hand, are for the most part limited to one source, the Apple Store.
Windows/PCs are increasingly connected to the mobile network using USB dongles and mobile Wi-Fi devices or simply tethered through smartphones. Windows/PCs continue to be a target for malware infections, being responsible for almost 39% of the malware infections observed in 2020.

Share of IoT infections has increased by 100ok loT devicesnow make up 32.72% of the infected devices observed. Compared with 2019, the share occupied by loT devices in the overall device breakdown has increased by 100'/e, from a previous share of 16.17 /o.
With the widespread proliferation of loT devices, it is to be expected that the number of loT infections will grow dramatically. As Figure 3 demonstrates, in 2020 this led to the increase of the share that loT infections have in the overall device breakdown.
The rate of success in infecting loT devices depends dramatically with the visibility of the devices to the internet. In networks where devices are routinely assigned public facing internet IP addresses, we find a high loT infection rate. In networks where carrier grade NAT is used, the infection rate is considerably reduced, because the vulnerable devices are not visible to network sca nning.
With the introduction of 5G well underway, it is expected that not only the number of loT devices will increase dramatically, but also the share of loT devices accessible directly from the internet will increase as well. A separate section of this report analyzes the security challenges in the 5G environment and highlights the important role that Threat Intelligence can play in addressing security issues in multiple systems of the 5G architecture.

An interesting trend has been seen in the appearance and proliferation of new mobile spyware and info-stealers, with more than half of all Android malware falling into this category. These types of malware make up one-third of all infections detected in mobile networks -- and when banking Trojans (a specialized form of info-stealer) are included, that percentage climbs to more than 50%.
Counting also the banking trojan, a specialized form of info stealer, the percentage surpasses 50%. This trend shows the shift of the interest of malicious actors toward stealing sensitive data and credentials, especially banking credentials. Adware remains a class very well represented, while infections with miners has decreased significantly (only one miner can be found among the Top 20 malwares, with a declining share).
Figure 6 illustrates the shares occupied by each type of Android malware as observed in 2020 in mobile networks around the world.

RES

Figure 7 shows residential infection rates since April 2017. These are reported on a monthly, per-residence basis, and then averaged across fixed network deployments of Nokia NetGuard Endpoint Security.
The average monthly residential infection rate for 2020 was 2.16%. Residential rates have been dropping consistently since 2015. The drop over the years can be attributed to: · Cybercriminals are focusing their effort on loT and mobile devices. · Residential networks are better protected from the internet by the
firewall features that are built into home routers. · The operating systems and application used on modern laptop and
desktop computers are more secure that the Windows/XP systems of the past.
One interesting aspect to note is that the monthly residential infection rate increased sharply in June 2020, almost doubling to 3.56%. This increase can be attributed to intensified phishing campaigns related to the Covid-19 pandemic.
This trend mirrors the trend observed in the case of mobile infections. As the residential infection rates reflect activity across fixed network deploy-ments of Nokia NetGuard Endpoint Security in North America, the increase of infection rates for fixed networks is delayed compared with the increase for mobile networks worldwide.

A very good overview of the current cyber security trends can be obtained by analyzing the number of distinct samples captured from the internet at large.
I II.''
Figure 10 shows the top 20 most prolific malware found on the internet. A large number of samples associated with a malware indicates that, the malware was distributed through numerous Trojanized applications or is part of libraries widely used in application development. A prolific malware may also indicate that the malware author is making a serious attempt to evade detection by anti-virus products. Polymorphic malware constantly changes its identifiable features in order to make detection with anti-malware programs more difficult. Many of the common forms of malware can be polymorphic, including viruses, worms, bots, Trojans or keyloggers.

Architecture in transformation (technology shift) Consumers are looking forward to taking advantage of the benefits of 5G, including improved speed, lower latency, increased capacity and greater flexibility.
For communications service providers (CSPs), deploying 5G will be a challenge, mainly due to the sweeping changes in their current infrastructure. These changes are driven by the new technologies and paradigms that are specific to 5G.
The technologies listed below support fulfilling the main 5G requirements, including extremely fast control plane procedures, extremely low user plane latency and the highest degree of energy efficiency. At the same time, the introduction of these technologies brings about serious security challenges that will be discussed later.
Radio Access Network (RAN):The RAN is a collection of edge-located functions that connect a mobile device to the CSP's core network. Due to latency requirements and network load of 5G, the traditional ways of deploying RAN equipment are not well-suited for the new requirements. A new, cloud-based virtual RAN (vRAN) approach provides the necessary functionality for 5G; performance,

flexibility and cost-efficiency that isn't available in fixed-function RAN equipment.
Network Functions Virtualization (NFV):NFV decouples network functions, like firewall or encryption, from dedicated -- and proprietaryhardware appliances, and instantiates them as software-based Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on off-the-shelf servers that can be located on the customer premises, in the Communication Service Provider's network, or in the cloud.
Software-defined networking (SDN):The main concept is to decouple the infrastructure of wireless networks from expensive, closed hardware and shift it to an intelligent software layer running on commodity hardware.

Network slicing:One of the newest technologies enabled by 5G, it allows for different levels of security to be offered to users of different services. Each network slice is an isolated end-to-end network tailored to fulfill diverse requirements needed by each specific application.
Edge clouds: In a 5G mobile network architecture, most of the network functions run in cloud environments. What is specific to 5G is that these cloud environments are not restricted to central clouds but will comprise a number of highly distributed edge cloud deployments in order to facilitate mobile edge computing close to the mobile devices.

User scenarios evolving On the consumer side, one of the defining features of 5G is the widening spectrum of stakeholders: CSPs may offer not only end-user communication services, but also provide complete virtual networks or "network slices" specialized for specific applications. These may be operated by various verticals, each one with specific requirements.
New user scenarios always introduce new security challenges, so it is important to review some of the scenarios that are going to benefit from 5G capabilities and are expected to experience widespread acceptance.

Security requirements and expectations from subscribers It is clear that security will not only be fundamental to 5G success -- it will be the major differentiator for service providers.
The successof 5G depends on the capability to ensure not only a high level of security and privacy for subscribers, but also to combat various forms of attacks against the integrity and availability of the services these networks provide. Privacy/encryption and authentication remain key. 5G networks must support a very high level of security and privacy for their users (not restricted to humans) and their traffic.

loT: 5G networks are promising not only increased data rates but also low-latency data communication for time sensitive loT applications. 5G will also enable connectivity of massive numbers of loT devices. This will lead to more loT applications where the devices not only act as sensors but increasingly interact with the real world.
M2M: Ubiquitous connectivity and guaranteed QoS in 5G will allow development of machine-tomachinenetworks.Connected devicescommunicate between themselves and with a centralized site that monitors and controls their operations, all automatically and without human intervention.

Availability becomes much more critical in the 5G era. This is due to the proliferation of serious applications (not only limited to data collection) in life-affecting verticals. In these cases, dependability of the network is paramount.
The subscribers of Communication Service Providers offering 5G services increasingly expect that their CSP provides a certain protection against cyber threats and are not left alone to deal with these threats. The customers will not only subscribe to communication services, but also cyber security services. Rapid and efficient responses to threats is expected from the CSP.

Real-time applications:From critical infrastructure to autonomous vehicles, 5G will allow a new type of applications that were not possible before, as the latency and resiliency were not high enough.

It is also essential to meet new regulatory requirements, as defined by 3GPP and the ETSI ISG NFV, the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) for software-defined networking, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Security threats -- old and new (attacker shift) The sweeping changes that are taking place in the 5G ecosystem open ample opportunities to malicious actors to take advantage of vulnerabilities of the new technologies.
For Communication Service Providers, it is a major challenge to provide a fully dependable, secure NFV environment. SDN bears the threat that control applications may wreak havoc on a large scale by erroneously or maliciously interacting with a central network controller. The network infrastructure of Communication Service Providers becomes more accessible to the attackers, so CSPs are increasingly targeted by sophisticated malicious actors.
Another window of opportunity for malicious actors is the appearance of new usage scenarios on the subscriber side. Each new usage scenario introduces new technologies, which leads to an increaseofthe attack surface.
At the same time, life-affecting usage scenarios will only increase the motivation of malicious actors, as there are more opportunities for inflicting damage and extracting ransom.

Security architecture for 56 A robust security architecture for 5G needs to take into account the particularities of the 5G ecosystem,new usage scenariosand requirements/ expectations regarding the level of security provided throughout.
It is therefore essential to: a) Consider security from the perspective of the
subscribers. It is essential to support a variety of new use cases and identify trends. One concrete trend is the shift away from security controls at the device level (because of low resources). Another trend is the disappearance of perimeter security. Such trends lower the security posture of devices connected to the 5G network and places more responsibility on the CSP side.
b) Consider security from the perspective of the CSP. In the 5G era, CSPs will become themselves targetsofattacks,w ith dire consequences for the availability of communication services offered to subscribers. It is also important to reconsider some current elements in the approach to security due to shifting networking paradigms, such as Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN).
At the same time, CSPs must not only protect their infrastructure, but also play an increasingly significant role in providing security services to their subscribers.

The cornerstones of a successful 5G security architecture are:
Baked-in security: Security must be considered as part of the overall architecture and built into the architecture right from the start.
Security automation: Combine automated holistic security orchestration and management with automated, intelligent security controls. Automated holistic security orchestration and management is required to manage security efficiently and consistently throughout a network. Predictive security controls should act autonomously and have the capability to adapt themselves to cope with ever-changing and evolving security threats.
Redundancy:A multi-layered defense-in-depth approach with intentional redundancies increases the security of a system as a whole and addresses many different attack vectors.
End-to-end security:Security coverage should
span alclomponents ofthe 5G ecosystem, from device to CSP infrastructure to cloud. Any ofthe components can be attacked, compromising the security of the entire system.
· Centralized security solution:End-to-end ~ security must be managed through a central point of control. This allows the set-up and maintenance of effective security mechanisms, as well as a secure operation of the entire network to help network operators disclose such activities at an early stage, thus reducing greater harm. This can be achieved by correlating data from systems across the network, paired with automated workflows for triggering countermeasures.

· Security services for subscribers:At a minimum, applications may rely on security mechanisms offered by the network: mechanisms for identifying and authenticating mobile devices and/or their subscriptions. In addition, subscribers will expect that CSPs take an active role in shielding them from attacks from the internet and to be notified if their devices become infected.

Threat Intelilgence takes the center stage Threat intelligence has always played an essential role in the success of any security solution. Both the host-based and network-based security appliances cannot perform without up-to-date threat intelligence.
In the 5G context, due to the complex 5G network architecture, new use cases and new security architectures, additionalrequirements are placed on threat intelligence.
· Increased accuracy:As mentioned before, 5G security relies increasingly on automation. The goal of automation is to take quick action upon detection of incidents, rather than just alerting a human operator who then evaluates the incident and takes action if the incident is deemed real and of a high enough severity. In this context, there is no room for false positives, as actions taken based on false positives can be very detrimental to the functioning and security of the entire system.
· Increased coverage:Traditionally, security systems are targeting the protection of end user devices. However, in the case of 5G, the distributed infrastructure of Communication Service Providers may also be targeted by malicious actors, so protection needs to be extended to cover those components as well. From a threat intelligence perspective, this amounts to a substantial increase in coverage necessary to protect the network assets.
· Correlationbetween attacks and postinfection activity: Correlating observed attacks with security incidents inside the system can

bring a lot of value by providing various clues leading up to a security incident. In a complex distributed system like 5G, this correlation becomes even more valuable for the automatic evaluation of security incidents and the initiation of preventative countermeasures.
· Good priority classification: It is always important to know if immediate action is required or alerting operators is sufficientI.n the case ofautomatic security
systems,this knowledge becomes even more important because it is not desirable to have a system that is over-reactive and performs potentially significant countermeasures if it is not necessary.
· Solid security requirements for what could be
impacted must bedefined: As automated workflows are increasingly used for triggering

countermeasures, it is essential to be able to predict the malware actions upon infection. This allows for taking preventive actions before the malware attempts to perform its malicious actions.
· Coverage ofallphases of attacks: Th reat intelligence need to cover all the phases of a cyber-attack, from discovery and initial attack to post-infection activities, lateral movement, data exfiltration and host exploitation (DDoS attacks, etc). Only by having accurate threat intelligence is it possible to detect malicious activity and automatically take preventive/corrective actions during all phases of the attack.
In the 5G system, there are multiple areas where threat intelligence is used by various components of the security architecture.

Network-based security solutions 5G offers security features focused on the interface between mobile devices and the network (e.g., IPSec tunnels to protect the data between the base stations and the core network, identification and authentication), but doesn't do anything to protect the devices against attacks.
Subscriber's devices, often without the owner's knowledge, can be corrupted by malware and attack the network. At its most dangerous, many corrupted devices may form a mobile botnet that carries out large-scale attacks against the network. Future networks will suffer due to a continuous increase of loT botnets like Mirai or toolkits for mobile devices like DroidJack, which has recently been used to attack web services and network infrastructure.
Host-based security solutions are not a good solution for protecting the devices connected to the 5G network, as most of them have limited resources.
As a result, network-based detection of suspicious device behaviour on Internet Protocol (IP), as well as application layer protocols, becomes imperative as it protects not only subscribers and the data on their devices, but also the networks themselves. Network-based detection scales well with the exponential increase in the number of devices connected to 5G networks, and provides very good detection of attacks and post-infection activity (e.g., propagation, command and control communication and other malicious actions).
With the role of network-based security solutions increasing in importance in 5G networks, the quality of threat intelligence that powers them needs to increase in terms of coverage, accuracy, etc.

Security orchestration Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) technology has emerged as the primary choice for ensuring security of 5G networks. It allows for the streamlining of security operations in three key areas: threat and vulnerability management, incident response, and security operations automation.
Threat intelligence plays a key role in elevating the performance of the SOAR solution. As it relates to security automation (the automatic handling of security operations-related tasks), threat intelligence plays a centralrole in the analysis of vulnerability and threat data received from multiple sources.

There are several use cases where the SOAR platform benefits from threat intelligence:
· Endpoint diagnostics Threat intelligence helps to efficiently manage the overwhelming number of alerts from logs
and variousdata feeds, assess the riskofnew indicators and respond to endpoint threats
proactively.
· Vulnerability management SOAR platform needs to rapidly identify emerging threats before they actually hit targets in the 5G networks. Threat intelligence helps identifying the security measures that are necessary to protect the system before attacks happen.

CSP and cloud infrastructure Threat intelligence plays a critical role in protecting the infrastructure of Communication Service Providers. In the 5G world, most of the network functions are expected to run in Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environments or the cloud. Attacks on NFVs can have a devastating impact on the capability of telcos to offer services and, as a result, can affect the availability of communication services to subscribers.
There are multiple NFV cyber security challenges that need to be overcome:
· Security pitfalls of openStack: Protect OpenStack controller and OpenStack compute nodes where, in telecom NFV networks, the compute nodes are outside of the core.
· Both thedata plane and the control plane are implemented in software: This increases the attacksurface and increases the risks foran
successfulattack.
· The controlplane of each function is open for remote operation: With NFV, an entire host can be programmed by an external controller, which provides the opportunity for those devices to be taken over by a malicious actor.
· Malware may propagate easily across VMs and hosts: The challenge with NFV is that the entire network is made up of hosting machines that run a virtualization environment. Being outside the security perimeter, malware software can propagate itself throughout the network.

The Nokia Threat Intelligence Lab focuses on the behavior of malware network communications to develop detection rules that identify malware infections based on command-and-control communication and other network behavior. This approach enables the detection of malware in the service provider's network and the detection rules developed form the foundation of Nokia's network-based malware detection product suite.
To accurately detect that a user is infected, our detection rule set looks for network behavior that provides unequivocal evidence of infection coming from the user's device. This behavior includes: · Malware command-and-control (CKC) communications · Backdoor connections · Attempts to infect others (for example, exploits) · Excessive email · Denial of Service (DoS) and hacking activity

Four main activities support our signature development and verification process: 1. Monitor information sources from major security vendors and
maintain a database of currently active threats 2. Collect malware samples (>200,000/day), classify and correlate
them against the threat database 3. Execute samples matching the top threats in a sandbox
environment and compare against our current signature set 4. Conduct a detailed analysis of the malware's behavior and
build a new signature, if a sample fails to trigger a signature
