It's ah ohgaithy for us - we' ll make afewPgr sant, So yay us, but it's not like we'ra.marking up eur costs by a factor of three or four er 5ve, It!s a great trend. for tbe hshrstry, aud move pewer to, the:developers, It'snotwfthoutuontreveray %a ju@ had thaatory up onKurogamer aboutControland 'theOu'ter%tide new beingKptu glareaxclusives,,aud peoplearen't happy about tk going as %sr ass~* Epic ts ktlltng Pc gaming' and asking how' ls Utts putthlg the customer tbsp Tim gweeneyt %oil now weVe wtukiugwith partners like Bumble to open up thmr ability to sall access to Epic Store games without any revemssshare fax Epic.

Epid's big motive here is 'to 5x the supply side economies of the ~ b usbmss, right, It':s not a seay objective,
I understand garnersnotapprecmting that, these are thmgs that am Invkdble to you, How much of your moony ~ to a ~developer,,hew much goes to'Valve - you just can' t

Very fess developers have ggrtperuerit pr'oth margin. This Isn't sumesmaUdiffeienea to them. They have all'tha costa of building their game,payiug their empkryees, marketing the@ game,p,aying for user aetluisitign. Per most games,, the ~ makes mme pm5t than the developer makes.

The economies of being on oneofthese gDpar oerit stores, when you have all those other costs, it's k very stark deui'sion for a developer to male, and it weighed, on us fm a, very loag time, hiow wAre ~ Ati s .level of success,,aud the level of success we' vehad witbportnite, we' re committed to ~ tho se decisions a lot easier for other deedopers

Something Valve has carne under Bre fer recently is policing,,-and Valve!s unwiIIIagaeae to get in 'tke way of certain games getting up there, stiqmta' goingio be
yonr ~precahv'
Tim Sweeneyi 'Them are two parts to Epic, and usx have ta o diiferent philosophies towunis this,. First of all weVe making creative tooh like the Unreal Fxxgine we ~ them available tp anyttne fqr any legal Inppnse, and we' ve np autlmriiy or right to judgi what you'ie domg aad'siay whether or'not you'xi} aIInw id to do it. It's like Microsoft Word.-- Mieiosott doesn't say yuu osn't write about anarchy in our word proeessorli But when Epic ie selling, a product to customers, we feel we. have a ~ i bi h ty to moderate for a nmsonabie level of quality, snd also areasonable level of decency. Aad. so we won't be selling games that are really low quality, we' ll have a hmuan review every gene end make a basis quabty decision abtaxt thmgs that am submitted. And we' ll avoid potu snd gamgsthat aiu ~ y d g sINxed trt create oentiovemy astheir busamxeosdsel. VA don't feel Intd about that --tbe pc's an openplatform, if:we tgll a developer-no they eaa sSIII distribute the% ~ t o their websxte or any othernumher of outlets.

soiae of what you' ve aixanuaced - thl MegaGraaisthiit's offering up $100@00,000, the mveaue split - almost feels Itke it's cdndng frn n smne place kf phBaathropy. What's your gmdmg motivation -- is,ii. just ta make, as mach money napossible, eris it auras Mgher eaamg
Tim Sweeney: %uI1 you.know I think tbs bmt campmies osn ~ b o t h toipnhreigr,ht The Unreal dev grants, we bad o live miUion~doHer fimd distributed ever fern years with no stimgs attached to jxrojeets that we thr@gin we o'ould help.

It's that Idnd of long term view of tidags. %'e dank have a nxam of acsomitants analysing ench graut hacmg tbs revenue ibat's coming bask its Epic, Ratber wexd look at belpmg everyone as awhole, on worthy pnjj'eats, eixdthat'agoing to produce somesuccessesand advances. Another thing alongside that Is you' re running the world'a Imgest game with For'tniro.Isthere an element of social respoasibiBsy that cmites with that> Tim Sweeney: It's a miraculously pogitive p i ty.A t 'tbe scalp it's rhaIIy oapresedfsitod havmg such apunitive gmup ofplayers, playiag a punitive exrperienot}aad a lack of majne aontroveray around. That's partlyset by the spirit of Forinite, whish is a fun, quirky exyeirienoe that doesn't take itseit too seriously. When you'ie elhniaated,, half tbe time yoake Iau~ b ecause what happened was bilious. %e've lemnt a lat Iiomthe aad from tbe enpexienoeef other gatnee thai have become negattwe --we and the way wemakedemsioasabout oui ecosystem, low we sixpioaoh things and bow we makedecisions about what we do anddoa't do has areally profounxdeifeet oa that, There's oae element that I know that some people Iiad icky -- itseemsabnost unfah to single out Porinite because tide is a majordty of video games i--t's a very light hearted game with cnrtuoayoharacterswhe m'e wielding very nsattstte guns which Ia problematic.
