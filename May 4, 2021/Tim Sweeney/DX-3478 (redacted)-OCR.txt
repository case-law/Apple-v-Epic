I apologize for that, just a lot going on but that's not an excuse.You've obviouslyseen our Samsung announce and now ourback and forthwith Apple.Atthe highest levels of MS we are committed to pushing on these policies and continuing to expand our console platforms capabilities. You can chime in as you feel comfortable. But I did want to just let you know that I have your point on xCloud on other consoles (haven't given up), F2P outside of Gold (we will get there and I want to partner with you) and our Store entitlement ideas as items I'm going to review with you to make progress. I'm committed to that, just behind.
Hope you are well,
