PRIVILEGED& CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT

Overview of Project Liberty

Why Do This?

Pass mobile payment processing savings on to consumers through a direct Epic customer relationship Create a better ecosystem for all developers- ability to invest in development and creative vs pay a tax Removeanti-competitive barriers toEpicintroducingacompetingmobile appstore oniDSandAndroid Feasible economics for Epic and creators, in preparation for Valkyrie paying creators for Fortnite based content
