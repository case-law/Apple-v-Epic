Dearly Clerk

Congrats on the success with Fortnite. I'd love to be a great plafform and service for Fortnite allowing you to reach maximum potential for the garne across a fidevices.
I was aware the team was there today and I instructed them to be supportive of your asks.
The stickiest of the issues is cross-purchase. I think it's solvable so I'm not saying this is a blocker but we do need to work through the scenario with you. You know this but it's worth stating that compared to PCs and phones, consoles are a very subsidized hardware device. That subsidy obviously relies on soRware and service sales to recoup the customer acquisition costs of the console. Just like we wanted to support, and did, moving Fortnite to F2P for the BR mode I want to support here. A scenario where a F2P Fortite on Xbox results in our digital store's price for Fortnite items being non-competitively priced relative to other cross-purchaseplafformsisan issueweneed tomitigate.
Net is I want to work through this with you. I wish we had more time to work through the iOS and Android scenario, sounds like we basicallyhave2-3 weeks. I don't knowhowwegetahead ofthis inthefuture. I thinkwe'vebeenpartners onFortnite so hopefully we can collaborate on roadrnaps more going forward.
Unrelated, one thing you should look at is Mixer and NypeZone on PUBG. We see good viewership for Fortnite on Mixer and we' d love the opportunity to innovative with you here.
I' ll follow up with the team post-visit and we' ll work through this. Cool opportunity.

Hi Phil,
Folks from the Xbox team are in North Carolina today, and we had a productive discussion in which we disclosed the following highly-confidential plan:
We' re bringing Fortnite Battle Royale to iOS and Android in late February. Not a durnbed-down version, but the full experience, running at 30 FPS and supporting cross-play, cross-purchase, and cross-progression.
It' ll bring together current and potential garners in real-world social groups: college dorms, high school classes, even kids, as only Minecraft has done so far. We want to work with Microsoft to unblock all console-mandated interop restrictions in time for this launch. I'm confident we' ll achieve this with the other guys and, at any rate, plafforrns that block interop will be siloed.
Bringing iOS and Android players into a console-quality game experience with all of their friends will be a game-changing experience. It will sell lots ofXboxesasplayers arepulled into thesmall-screenexperiencesocially, andwant to upgrade to the muchbetter big-screenexperience. Thegoodthiswill doforconsolegamingasawholewill far outweighanyzero-sumeffectsof cross-console purchase portability.
