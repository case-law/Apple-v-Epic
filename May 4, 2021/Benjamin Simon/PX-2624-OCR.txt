Customizing Your Practice
Setting Your Music and Voice I can't hear the instructor's voice! Where's the volume control? How do I change the music? I'd prefer to listen to my own music as I practice. How do I turn off the music completely? How do I change the voice I hear? How do I change the language I hear? I want to hear the most instruction possible when doing the poses. I want to zen out and hear the least amount of instruction available.
