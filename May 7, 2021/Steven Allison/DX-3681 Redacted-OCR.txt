I feel like we can probably get Phase 2 Partner Comms for console and first party mobile in front of Tim today. Do you agree it's ready?

, having Loc back for the video copy by 9AM Tuesday, at this point, will not be possible. We are not planning on sending *any* Loc out for translation until Tuesday morning. So, we may just have to go live with Loc'ed versions later. Happy to discuss this further. Depending on the copy that is needed, we can maybe use our LQA guys to handle it, but we, at this point, also don't have all languages available internally.

a free game giveaway on EGS hasn't historically caused a payment service outage across our ecosystem, right? that or an inability for players in FN to login are my two concerns. is also worried that EGS will dominate the news cycle this day but Total War is relatively niche, right?

"Steven Allison"

8/6/2020 5:01:19 PM +00:00

GTA caused EGS to fall over, and issues transnacting for it on launcher and web but my recollection is FN was fine throughout (worth checking in with the ecomm and platform team re 5/14/20 re: services stability besides EGS being overwhelmed) on all platforms -- it was more that the traffic pointed at EGS web and launcher was so much larger than we even expected we had issues for about 8 hours getting that sorted out re: scaling there.

we' ve separated our paid and free DB's to avoid causing additional stress in situations like this. we expanded our DBs originally for our EGS mega sale, and it worked great. We had 80K+ transaction/minute during ARK's peak for free games. I don't expect to have any payment/transaction issues with Liberty and Total
War on the same day.

To be ready for multiple scenarios, we should target 8am Thu 8/13 as moment the video goes live in Party Royale. That's current "earliest possible moment".

"Alee Shobin"' this meeting will be great

"Carlos Almeida"

8/6/2020 11;16;31 PM+00;00

Hey guys, as much as it pains me to suggest this, should we meet tomorrow instead of Monday? I just fear that if we wait until Monday to 'start', it may be too late to plan this accordingly. Thoughts?

"Cameron Payne" Loc plan is SRTs, no VO?

8/6/2020 11:16:59 PM+00:00

"Cameron Payne" What earliest possible for all languages?

8/6/2020 11:19:01 PM+00:00

We will be localizing all the text in the video and doing SRTs for the VO. Checking with Carlos for ETA of localized translations..

Ok, so it sounds like we would be okay to receive the Loc back by 5PM on 8/12, however, depending on what comes out of the meeting tomorrow, the Loc delivery date/time (for the video content ONLY ) may need to be expedited. I'm already sending over 7K words to be translated in a day, so I'm trying not to throw many more caveats to this vendor to avoid other issues, but I did meet with them today and told them that
there was a potential for us to need the video copy sooner than 5PM on 8/12, so they are aware.

"Sarah Germano"

8/6/2020 11;46:37 PM+00;00

Let's discuss with Chanc in the meeting tomorrow, to confirm timing on his end. We can plan to deliver all three versions to Media Services Wed night -- but we do not want to start processing until we know for sure which version we are going with.

"Jeremy Hoffmann"

8/6/2020 11:47:07 PM +00:00

sorry, still in an art review. I' ll keep Mondays for now and can cancel is everything is resolved

"Chanc Hollander" <

8/6/2020 11:53:46 PM +00:00

Yup let's discuss. Short rule of thumb is every minute of content takes two minutes to process. With alternate audio tracks additional processing will need to be done.

"Jeremy Hoffmann" 45 second video. only english audio.

"Matt Grandstaff" <

8/7/2020 1:Q4:53 AM +00:00

it would be in the blog rotation, but I think we'd keep it pinned

"Matt Grandstaff" Pin Mega Drop first. Once in phase 2, pin that.

8/7/2020 1:Q5:08 AM +00:00

"Michael House" As an FYI, we' ve begun transferring copy that's ready into the Loc Tracker.
