Matt can I please give you a quick call to brief you on this? You have a critical flaw in your app review process that is impacting us and many other apps, and it's not getting much attention from your dev relations / app store biz managers I'm afraid.

Thanks and all the best.

Michael -- we need some help please. We are suffering from repeated egregious theft of our IP in the Apple App Store. Basically developers (we think based in Asia) are submitting paid apps to Apple called "Headspace" with imagery, description, branding etc identical to ours. Shockingly, Apple are approving these apps, and when the users buy the apps they are left with nothing but some scammy chat rooms in the background. This has now happened to us four separate times over the past month. We have proof that consumers are confused by this because users have left negative comments on our social channels as a result. We have filed complaints with Apple, but there is zero sense of urgency (let alone an apology) to address the core issue (which is with their review process) over there, so we'd like to speak to a more senior contact.
By the way, similar scam activity was reported by the New York Times a couple weeks ago, here. Can you please introduce us to whoever you think might be best placed to help within Apple?
Thanks and best regards
