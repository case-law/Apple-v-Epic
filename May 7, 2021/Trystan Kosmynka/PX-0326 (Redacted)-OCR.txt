Teanl,
We' re writing to let you tmow about some upcoming changes in App Review.
In 2016, we launched theA S t o re Im rovements initiativewith two main objectives: ensuring that pmblematic apps/developers stay out of the program and off of our platform, aud to prevent their apps bom reaching reviewers and our customers.
Since then, we have terminated over 74,000 developers fromthe program, and removed over 1 million apps.
To continue that progress, effective immediately, the Technical Invesngations (TD team will be joiningthe App Store Improvements (ASQteam and reporting directly to Bran Ben-Zvi. The App Review Misleading Fraud (ARMF) and App Review Compliance (ARC) teams will be reporting directly to Ali Menbari.
This merge will strengthen the ability for ASI to identify new sigaals that arebeing obfuscated or called dynamically, ultimately ensuring that problematicapps are prevented I'mm being available on the App Store.
