We will work with engineering and look into this.

There appears to be rampant use of location data (based on SDKs that simp it up after a user approves) far beyond what people think they are allowing just for the app experiences they expect. We should look into his and propose what to do about it (More limited use of the data in terms? Ban any SDKs that are driving this? Force explicit disclosure of the exact uses of the data? Etc)

Your Location Data Is Being Sold -- Often Without Your Knowledge

Location-based ads are growing, which means the industry has more ways than ever to track you

As location-aware advertising goes mainstream -- like that Jack in the Box ad that appearswhenever you getnear one, in
whichever app you have open at the time -- and as popular apps harvest your
lucrative location data, the potential for leaking or exploiting this data has never
been higher.
It's true that your smartphone's location-
tracking capabilities can be helpful, whether
it's alerting you to traffic or inclement weather. That utility is why so many of us
PX-0365.2 APL-APPSTORE 09825973

are giving away a great deal more location data than we probably realize. Every time you say "yes" to an app that asks to know your location, you are also potentially authorizing that app to sell your data.
Dozens of companies track location and/or serve ads based on this data. They aim to
compilea complete record ofwhere
everyone in America spends their time, in order to chop those histories into market segments to sell to corporate advertisers.
Marketers spent $1.6 billion on location-
targeted ads served to mobile devices like
smartphones and tablet computers in 2017.
That's 4o% of all mobile ad
spending, research firm BIA Kelse estimates, and it expects spending on these ads to double by 2021.
The data required to serve you any single ad might pass through many companies' systems in milliseconds -- from data broker
to ad marketplace to an agency's custom

system. In part, this is just how online advertising works, where massive
marketplaces hold continuing high-speed
auctions for ad space.

But the fragmentation also is because of a
very real fear of the public backlash and
legal liability that might occur if there were a breach. Imagine the E uifax breach, except instead of your Social Security number, it's everywhere you' ve been,
including your home, your workplace and your children's schools.
The fix, at least for now, is that with most
individual data vendors holding only parts of your data, your complete, identifiable
PX-0365.4 APL-APPSTORE 09825975

profile is never all in one place. Giants like Facebook and Al habet 's Google, which do have all your data in one place, say
they are diligent about throwing away or not gathering what they don't need, and
eliminating personally identifying
information from the remainder.
Yet as the industry and the ways to track us expand, the possibility that our
whereabouts will be exposed multiplies. If
you' veever feltclever because an app on your phone asked to track your location and
you said no, this should make you feel a
little less smug: There are plenty of ways to track you without getting your permission. Some of the most intrusive are the easiest to implement.
The spy in your pocket
Your telco knows where you are at all times, because it knows which cell towers your phone is near. In the U.S., how much data service providers sell is u to them.

Another way you can be tracked without
your knowing it is through any open Wi-Fi hot spot you might pass. If your phone's Wi-
Fi is on, you' re constantl b r o adcastin a
unique address and a history of past Wi-Fi
connections. Retailers sometimes use these addresses to identi r e e a t customersa, nd they can also use them to track you as you go from one oftheir stores to another. WeatherBug, one of the most popular
weather apps for Android and iPhone, is owned by the location advertising
company GroundTruth . It's a natural fit: Weather apps need to know where you are and providevalue in exchange for that information. But it also means that app is gathering data on your location any time the
app is open -- and even when it isn' t, if you
agreed to always let it track your location. That data is resold to others.

GroundTruth also says it gathers location data from "over a hundred thousand" other apps that have integrated bits of its code. Company President Serge Matta declined to
disclose which apps. App makers agree to
harvest location data because it grants them access to GroundTruth's mobile advertisin network.
This data is what enables marketers like Jack in the Box to push an advertiser's message to potential customers near its restaurants. A typical engagement includes
pushing location-based promotions or coupons through mobile ads, says Iwona
Alter, chief marketing officer of Jack in the Box.
Every month GroundTruth tracks 7o
million people in the U.S. as they go to work

Anonymize, de-anonymize
Companies like GroundTruth try to ensure they aren't tracking or storing data on individuals. Most of what they sell are
anonymous blobs of people who fit
particular descriptions -- "soccer moms who intend to buy an SUV," for example. But
they also occasionally hand off location data
to a third party, such as LiveRamp, owned
by data broker Acxiom, before it is matched
u p with o t entiall er s o nall i d e nt i ' n information, such as your complete shopping history at a retailer. LiveRamp is almost like an escrow company for data.
GroundTruth demonstrated its ability to
target a mobile ad to a single location by
pushing this message to everyone at the

Companies like Acxiom could be prime
targets for hackers, said Chandler Givens,
chief executive of TrackOff, which develops
software to protect user identity and personal information. LiveRamp goes to great lengths to mathematically obfuscate
our individual identities, said Sheila
Colclasure,chief data ethics officer at LiveRamp and Acxiom. But some security researchersfear data brokers like Acxiom
might be compromised already, or could be someda .
Acxiom and LiveRamp in the U.S. are governed by federal and state laws that regulate the collection and use of data in the particular businesses their clients are
involved in, Ms. Colclasure said. Nearly

every year, a bill comes up in the Senate or House that would regulate our data privacy -- the most recent was after the
Equifax breach -- but none has passed. In
some respects,the U.S. appears to be movin backward on r i v ac r ot e c tions. There might never be a breach of our location data. But given the drumbeat of hacks of both companies and governments, it's hard to believe hackers aren't at least trying to compromise such a high-value target. %Trite to Christopher Mims at christo her.mims w s ' . com
