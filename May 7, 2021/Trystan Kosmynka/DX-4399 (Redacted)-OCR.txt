Eddy: In 2016, the App Store generated a record $28.6B (click) up 40% Y/Y.
If we treated the App Store as a standalone company, that would make the App Store ╣98 on the Fortune 500.

Let's start with Paying Accounts.

In early November, we launched Alipay as a new payment method in China, and it's made a huge impact on our business...

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

DX-4399.012

APL-APPSTORE 09848621

Since launch, Alipay has delivered over 1 2M New-to-Paying accounts. Over the past 4 weeks, Alipay makes up nearly 60% of total new-to-paying accounts in China.

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

DXP399.013

APL-APPSTORE 09848622

What's also amazing is that Alipay now makes up over 50% of China App Store billings (53% in April)...

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

DXP399.014

APL-APPSTORE 09848623

...with over $2B in billings from Alipay, just in its first 6 months.

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

DX-4399. 01 5

APL-APPSTORE 09848624

But it's not just all about Alipay. We' ve been hard at work adding more payment methods to the store, including 20 carriers in 12 countries for Carrier Billing, and adding 10 new currency conversions.

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

DXP399.016

APL-APPSTORE 09848625

Looking ahead, we' ll be launching four more carriers for Carrier Billing later this month, as well as support for Wallets like PayPal and WeChat Pay later this year.
And also we' ll be adding some important currency conversions, most notably for Brazil and Korea.

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

APL-APPSTORE 09848626

In addition to more paying accounts, another growth driver was our paying accounts spending more money, or Average Revenue Per Paying User.

You' ve seen this before, but as a refresher, a few years ago we started looking at our account base in terms of spend levels -- on the FREE side, we split by customers with and without payment method on file (or PMOF) LOW (typically a one and done customers paying in a paid app or game) MEDIUM - typically entering the low end of medium with a subscription purchase HIGH segment - vast majority of their spend is in games via IAP

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

DX-4399. 01 9

APL-APPSTORE 09848628

This is how each segment contributes in share of customers and billings: FREE is our largest segment - over half the customers - these customers cannot pay Free+ PMOF - they can pay,butdon*t Then we have those that do pay - the low end capturing 10% of the accounts, but only 5% of the billings MEDIUM segment is T%o%fdaccounts, 40% of billings
HIGH segment - paying in excess of $450 in the quarter, 1/2 a percent of all accounts, but they generate over half the billings

Overall ARPPU grew 19% for the year, and is at an all-time high at over $70 per quarter. What's driven this up the average
growth in HIGH SPENDERS
Very encouraging is that the MEDIAN is growing, reaching a record $11 last quarter, and up 12% YN.
Annual ARPPU is $148 (+19% YoY) Annual MRPPU is $16.40 (+1 2%YoY)

Here's a look at our top grossing apps from 2016.
Not only are these all games, but they' re freemium games, meaning they' re free to download, and you then spend money using In-App Purchases to get more features or levels.

One of the growth drivers for 2016 were some notable BREAKOUT HITS. All of these launched last year, except for Netflix.
We included Netflix as a breakout hit because they added IAP in late 2015, and we helped them launch in an additional 100 countries in early 201 6.

These 10 hits contributed $3.3B in billings -- or 15% of our overall 40% YN growth. By comparison, that's $1.3B more than
Top 10 breakout hits from 2015, or 63% Y/Y.

-Clash Royale: Real-time multiplayer player card battle game from the developer of Clash of Clans, Hay Day and Boom Beach. Game is approachable, fun and
challenging. 2v2 mode coming in the next few months. - Pokemon Go: Mobile treasure hunting app with made unique with compelling social/community aspects. First meainstream game to use augmented reality. Pokemon
Company is owned by Nintendo, but this game was published by Niantic Labs, originally a startup within Google that was eventually spun out. - Mobile Strike: MMO strategy game based on modern warfare from Palo Alto based developer of Game of War. - Glory Kings: MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game from Tencent that is almost identical to League of Legends, one of the top PC games in the world. Tencent
acquired League of Legends creator Riot Games in 2015. - Onmyoji: RPG (Role Playing Game) with card collecting and card battle elements from Chinese developer Netease. Art style of game is Japanese Anime. Expected to

The fourth and final growth driver in 2016 was Subscriptions...

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

APL-APPSTORE 09848639

To help further grow our subscription business, we launched several subscription features for developers last year, most notably an adjusted revenue share from 70/30 to 85/1 5 when a developer retains a paid subscriber for more than one year. Also, we expanded subscriptions to all categories, meaning lots of different types of apps can now offer subscriptions, most notably GAMES.

Phase 2 is American Express in US. Billing Retry: today we give up after 6 hours. Adding more customizations on retry Grace Period: We still need to establish a standard Apple duration. Give developers the ability to specify custom duration if they want to offer this. Free Trial Durations: Adding 3 day and 14 day options Receipt Enhancements: Gives developers more insight into subscriber status.

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

DX-4399. 036

APL-APPSTORE 09848645

We created Search Ads as another point of discovery for developers of all sizes, while complementing a user's Search
experience. Search Ads appear as the first listing in search results on the App Store for iPhone and iPad in the US,UK, AUS, and NZ. They are clearly marked as Ads (with a blue background and an "Ad" icon). The creative leverages the content of
the developer's App Store product page. The Search Ads that appear always feature apps that are highly relevant to a user's search. In fact, ad relevance is prioritized over ad spend so that no developer can dominate search results no matter how much they are willing to pay. Finally, we are considerate of the user's privacy by not creating profiles of their search history
and allowing them to see and control what data we use for the display of Search Ads.

APL-APPSTORE 09848847

With an average conversion rate of 50%, App Store users have responded positively to Search Ads downloading over 50
million apps per quarter. For our developers, Search Ads offer unprecedented cost efficiency (3x Facebook), as they only pay when a user taps on their ad. Search Ads are exposed to customers with a notably strong intent, given they' re viewing ads
tied to content they were actively searching for, so the cost per download is really efficient.

India is rapidly growing developer market, last year adding nearly 6,000 new PAID Apple Developer Program members. Many Indian developers also tend to focus on the international markets, which is quite unique among large emerging markets such as China which is predominantly focused on local consumption.
Despite active developer base, we identified that many Indian developers have great engineering skills, but lack deeper understanding of IOS platform and design conventions, therefore building 'lowest common denominator' apps and games. We wanted to change that by scaling WWDR efforts and launching a dedicate facility to accelerate app development, technology adoption and lift design quality.
A soft launch has been running since Feb 1st to test the centres facilities, processes, tools and team both functionally and to capacity or load with our grand opening in April.
Currently we have 11 tech sessions, 7 design and 3 tools sessions, in addition we run simultaneous hands on labs in each category. where as sessions are open to all registered Apple developers...Feedback so far has been great!
