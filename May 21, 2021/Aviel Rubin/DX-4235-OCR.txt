And FB's certificate has now been revoked. It's really unfortunate that this was the first real test of someone attempting to sidestep Apple.

I can't find the article, but I read a while ago that Facebook picked up on the success of Snapchat Stories due to having access to VPN traffic. They then copied it I; I for Instagram Stories and leveraged their network effect to be successfuL

So their oxrategy was look urhat works, copy it I: I without innovating, and rely on an existing large user base to become more successfuL

It's a shame this rogue means of distribution is being exploited for such a disgusting purpose by Facebook Makes it harder to legitunize the approach for gold purposes.

) Is it a soflware solution? A business strategy for obtaining enteqirise certificates from shell companies, which is / isn't clearly in violation of T/kC?

Would it be an option for you or Mark to reach out to thebuild io people and just enquire about their technique and how it's been received by Apple? Their interests are very much aligned with ours and I'm sure they are aware we recently bypassed the Play store with Fortuite

I can also work with lush/Pele/JoeB to sec if wc can figure out what they' re doing. Between us we probably know the most about the murky world of app signing but it appears to be something cleverer than the other grey-market app stores.
Other build io alternatives do take the route of obtaining enterprise certificates via dubious means though they are prone to being revoked. Build.io appear not to use enterprise carts. If I had to guess, and because they charge a per-device fee, they are doing something like on-demand ad-hoc signing using multiple $99 developer accounts. Ad-hoo signing is where a developer registers a device's UUID on Apple's website, addsit to a profile, and then puts the profile in the app bundle.

The key point here is that although we have an enterprise certificate it can be revoked at anytiine and we'd no longer be able to create installabale builds.
Whatever thebuilds io signing bypass isa we should also assume it's something Apple can patch when they have the incentive.
Doing the same Netflix A-B test where a cohort of users can only purchase V-Bucks via a website (that we can't directly link to) to measure impact would be interesting.
Pulling all purchases out of the app feels like the only way to ensure we don't end up with the app being removed from sale or in a Spotify-2016 situation where we can no longer update it until Apple consider us compliant.

(* They are understandably coy about what exactly they are doing, bw it doesappear that they do not needan enterprise cert like other side-loading websites)

Andrew Grant Tim pointed me to bolide)awho seem to have awaytoinskN sofiwsre onyourphone,without A being jail broken, using eerlilieatas.
Curious where this is goirN.

This form of sideloading combines iOS's built-in ability to install apps via links with an Enterpr/se cerhficate that allows apps to be installed on dev/ces wfihout requir/ng that their 0 VID be in the profile. Search 'iosOTA app distribufion' for lots ol detaih on how to set this up and what the manifests look like.

yah used exairily this method (just mlh irriernal websitss) at Luce sfilr & ILM to distribute internal apps and for testing things like the Star Wars app sowedidn't have to continuafiy manage UUIDs or devhe loaners. In the early days of Bacchus ws talked about getfing an enterprise certncate for similar reasons but it turned out to just be too much efiort (on our side) to get done.

The problem Is that using an Enterprise aooount for external distribution lilw this h firmly
against Apple's T&C. Technicafiy I don't think you' reevensupposedtousethem fortesting. Therearequfeiafew sfsislikengillfi.ic and they sre confinuafiy having fiwir profiles revoked as Apple plays whackw-rrole with them

I don't think the web store is something we could feasibly resource this year given competing Diesel and other priorities.
If we were feeling bold, we could port the launcher to iOS and ship s web-installable using thebuilds io appmach. I don't think we' ll be able to resoume that this year, but could potentially do it in early 2018. It sounds like there's signtflcant pressure on Apple to legitimize this or a similar approach.

Ok

This webstutf is currently not on engineering radar, but perhaps likely a component of kairos anyway
We have an enterprise certificate finally now, and have been using it to sign internal Epic apps with that, eg I hear for Kun's movie worldlow things. I' ll dig up my previous investigation

Let's dig into it.

Having Battle Pass aud VBucks purchasing on the web would be doable. For console, where there' s subsidized hardware etc, we could explicitly revenue-share back with Sony and Microsoft.
Let's also dig into the enterprise certificate approach. First question: Does Epic have an enterprise catificate compatible with iOST/

So Spotify does not allow you to create an account in their app, but you have to do it on website. *We alreadydo this*,butin an embedded browser. If we just open Safari, that might be a way to bypass in a similar way.
Then, what if we would enable buying vbucks on our website, or a battlepass 'subscription'"'7 A subscriplion is the same as Netflix is doing. But, this only works on website (cr our PC version) not in app
In 2015 Netflix sent people emails to this effect: The emaiis said the monthty fees through~So~f' comwouidbe $9.99 versus $f2.99
thmugh the App Store".
Discounting could also be an approach to drive people to the extra frichon of paying on a website. We could 'sell it" as well since our battlepass frequency does not gt inside
