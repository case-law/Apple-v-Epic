Eddy,
As you know, there are a lot of App Store discovery features that we have discussed for a while gast summer, in Cabo, etc.), but have not been scheduled due to competing priorities like Fuse, OTT, ATV App Store, etc. Several groups including the App Store team, Product Marketing, Engineering, Design, Operations, Production, Legal, WWDR, etc. have met over the past several months to brainstorm and hone in on some new features for 2016, and we' re excited with what we' ve come up with.

We are planning to present these to you before the end of this month as part of an overall 2016 App Store roadmap discussion. I just spoke with Gedikian and he's working with Pam to get the meeting scheduled. Our goal is to get your support and then share it with Phil (and Tim if he' s interested) to get full executive approval by mid-July, if not before.
We really want to wow our developers with some exciting new announcerneuts at WWDC 2016.

Best,

We will get back to him and there is always more to do but over the last year here some of the things that we have done to help developers getsdownloads analytics - so they can see how many users get to the page, search, see screenshots, etc  search - much better results for generic searches, misspellings, etc and removing Saudulent results  store progranunings - editor's choice badging, event rooms, best in class rooms  explore -- browsing by category and drilling to many sub-categories

Poorly written note but we do need to do much more to improve discovery.

As a developer I am completely insulted. Why? The amount of effort you are putting into discovery for artist on Apple Music. If the App Store had that level
discovery found in Apple Music it would enable the small husband and wife teams to compete with the large AAA studios. The very d
evelopers you are courting and putting the conference on for just got a big middle finger that they are second class citizens in Apple's efforts when it comes to discovery. Completely feeling insulted right now. For the first time
since 2009 I angry about how Apple is treating developers.

A new Apple TV with App Store support opening up gaming on the TV would have been a much better announcement for developers. Apple Music was a
waste of time and frankly the worse demo Apple has given in the 8 years.

Very unhappy developer. Matt Norris
