For e-books we allow them to do what Amazon's Kindle app does: they kick you out to their website to purchase the actual book. In the Amazon app, where you can purchase physical books, you can do so directly in the app.
They cannot useIAP to do physical goods, but they could use the Amazon Kindle model for both types of goods.

Hi Mark,
We had further questions:
Will Apple approve an application with an inapp purchase pmcess that does not use Apple's in-app purchase technology when a particular sale does not deliver a tangible good? (ie. Is completely virtual with no pnnted copy)

I am wonted that Apple will force us to implement 2 different in-app purchase processes. One for selling our tangible books, and another fior selling books that are purely virtual.
I wony about this because in the Amazon i phone app, they do not sell their electronic books. They point you to their eCommerce website. However, you can purchase tangible goods in that iPhone app. I have other similar examples. I

Hi Stephen,
Confirmed. IAP is limited to goods that are delivered within the app from which they are purchased
Most developers redirect to payment engines available on their website.

more deeply into your response if possible. Seeing as though our product simultaneously produces a digital eBook and a printed book for the consumer, it sounds asthough we need tobe using a non-Apple 'in-app purchase' process. If that's the case, can you please confirm and provide possible suggestions as to what other third-party providers we might look at to accomplish this required outcome?
Thank You, Stephen Clemente Executive Director Peterson's, a Nelnet company

Dear Apple,
We are in the middle of building another app at Peterson's and we have a question aboutin-app purchases. Our app is designed to allow a user to build their own book through the app. Meaning, the person can choose contact from multiple books andjoin that contentinto a book thatis unique to them. After doing so, they have the ability to receive a printed version of the book andlor a digital version of the book (eBook). In both cases the book will be custom to the user, meaning no products will ever be the same. Our question is, do we have to use the Apple in-app purchase process for this or can we use a non-Apple in-app purchaseprocess forthisapp? Please advise as soon as possible.
The following major retailers do NOT use In-App Purchase for their physical goods:
Amazon
