10.2

Obligations Regarding Apple Confidential Information

You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that

You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a

reasonable degree of care. You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the

purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party's benefit, without Apple's prior written consent. You further agree not to disclose or

writing by Apple. You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by law,

provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before disclosing the

Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential

Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential

Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.

10.3

Information Submitted to Apple Not Deemed Confidential

similar to or compete with Your Applications. Apple may also be developing its own similar or

competing applications and products or may decide to do so in the future. To avoid potential misunderstandings, Apple cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality obligations

or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any information that You may provide in

connection with this Agreement or the Program, including information about Your Application,

Licensed Application Information and metadata (such disclosures will be referred to as "Licensee

Disclosures" ). You agree that any such Licensee Disclosures will be non-confidential. Apple will be free to use and disclose any Licensee Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or

compensating You. You release Apple from all liability and obligations that may arise from the

receipt, review, use, or disclosure of any portion of any Licensee Disclosures. Any physical

materials You submit to Apple will become Apple property and Apple will have no obligation to

return those materials to You or to certify their destruction.

The following terms are in addition to the terms of the Agreement and apply to any use of the APN (Apple Push Notification service) in Your Application and/or in Your Pass or the delivery of Local Notifications to Your Application or Pass:

1.

Use of the APN and Local Notifications

1.1

Your Application and/or Your Pass may only access the APN via the APN API and

only if You have been assigned a Push Application ID or Pass ID by Apple. Except for the limited

purpose of Section 5 below, You agree not to share your Push Application ID or Pass ID with any

third party. You understand that Your Application will not be permitted to access or use the APN after expiration or termination of Your Agreement.

1.2

You are only permitted to use the APN and the APN APls for the purpose of sending

Push Notifications to Your Application or Your Pass on an iOS Product as expressly permitted by

the Agreement (including but not limited to this Attachment 1) and the APN Documentation, and

You must only do so in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations (including all

intellectual property laws). You further agree that You must disclose to Apple any use of the APN

as part of the submission process for Your Application.

1.3

You understand that before You send an end-user any Push Notifications through the

APN, the end-user must provide consent to receive such Notifications. You agree not to disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented consent panels or any Apple system

preferences for enabling or disabling Notifications functionality. If the end-user's consent to receive Push Notifications is denied or later withdrawn, You may not send the end-user Push

Notifications.

2.

Additional Requirements

2.1

You may not use the APN or Local Notifications for the purpose of sending

unsolicited messages to end-users or for the purpose of phishing or spamming, including, but not

limited to, engaging in any types of activities that violate anti-spamming laws and regulations, or

that are otherwise improper, inappropriate or illegal.

2.2

You may not use the APN or Local Notifications for the purposes of advertising,

product promotion, or direct marketing of any kind (e.g., up-selling, cross-selling, etc.), including,

but not limited to, sending any messages to promote the use of Your Application or advertise the

availability of new features or versions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may use the APN or

Local Notifications for promotional purposes in connection with Your Pass so long as such use is

directly related to the Pass, e.g., a store coupon may be sent to Your Pass in Passbook.

2.3

You may not excessively use the overall network capacity or bandwidth of the APN,

or unduly burden an iOS Product with excessive Push Notifications or Local Notifications, as may

be determined by Apple in its reasonable discretion. In addition, You agree not to harm or

interfere with Apple's networks or servers, or any third party servers or networks connected to the

APN, or otherwise disrupt other developers' use of the APN.

2.4

You may not use the APN or Local Notifications to send material that contains any

obscene, pornographic, offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind (text, graphics,

images, photographs, sounds, etc.), or other content or materials that in Apple's reasonable

judgment may be found objectionable by the end-user of Your Application or Your Pass.

Program Agreement

viruses or any other computer code, files or programs that may harm, disrupt or limit the normal

operation of the APN or an iOS Product, and You agree not to disable, spoof, hack or otherwise

interfere with any security, digital signing, verification or authentication mechanisms that are

incorporated in or used by the APN, or enable others to do so.

3.

Delivery by the APN or via Local Notifications

You understand and agree that in order to provide the APN and make Your Push Notifications available on iOS Products, Apple may transmit Your Push Notifications across various public networks, in various media, and modify or change Your Push Notifications to comply with the technical and other requirements for connecting to networks or devices. You acknowledge and agree that the APN is not, and is not intended to be, a guaranteed or secure delivery service, and You shall not use or rely upon it as such. Further, as a condition to using the APN or delivering Local Notifications, You agree not to transmit sensitive personal or confidential information belonging to an individual (e.g., a social security number, financial account or transactional information, or any information where the individual may have a reasonable expectation of secure transmission) as part of any such Notification, and You agree to comply with any applicable notice or consent requirements with respect to any collection, transmission, maintenance, processing or use of an end-user's personal information.

Your Acknowledgements

You acknowledge and agree that:

4.1

Apple may at any time, and from time to time, with or without prior notice to You (a)

modify the APN, including changing or removing any feature or functionality, or (b) modify,

deprecate, reissue or republish the APN APls. You understand that any such modifications may

require You to change or update Your Applications or Your Passes at Your own cost. Apple has

no express or implied obligation to provide, or continue to provide, the APN and may suspend or

discontinue all or any portion of the APN at any time. Apple shall not be liable for any losses,

damages or costs of any kind incurred by You or any other party arising out of or related to any

such service suspension or discontinuation or any such modification of the APN or APN APls.

extent You choose to access and use the APN, You do so at Your own initiative and are

responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to any local laws.

4.3

Apple provides the APN to You for Your use with Your Application or Your Pass, and

does not provide the APN directly to any end-user. You acknowledge and agree that any Push

Notifications are sent by You, not Apple, to the end-user of Your Application, and You are solely

liable and responsible for any data or content transmitted therein and for any use of the APN in

Your Application. Further, You acknowledge and agree that any Local Notifications are sent by

You, not Apple, to the end-user of Your Application, and You are solely liable and responsible for

any data or content transmitted therein.

4.4

Apple makes no guarantees to You in relation to the availability or uptime of the APN

and is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the APN.

4.5

Apple reserves the right to remove Your access to the APN or revoke Your Push

Application ID at any time in its sole discretion.

Apple may monitor and collect information (including but not limited to technical and

diagnostic information) about Your usage of the APN to aid Apple in improving the APN and other

Apple products or services and to verify Your compliance with this Agreement; provided however

public as required or permitted by law.

(to the Agreement) Additional Terms for Use of the In-App Purchase API

The following terms are in addition to the terms of the Agreement and apply to any use of the InApp Purchase API in Your Application:

1.

Use of the ln-App Purchase API

1.1

You may use the In-App Purchase API only to enable end-users to access or receive

content, functionality, or services that You make available for use within Your Application (e.g.,

digital books, additional game levels, access to a turn-by-turn map service). You may not use the

In-App Purchase API to offer goods or services to be used outside of Your Application.

1.2

You must submit to Apple for review and approval all content, functionality, or

services that You plan to provide through the use of the In-App Purchase API in accordance with

these terms and the processes set forth in Section 6 of the Agreement. For all submissions, You must provide the name, text description, price, unique identifier number, and other information

that Apple reasonably requests (collectively, the "Submission Description" ). Apple reserves the

right to review the actual content, functionality or service that has been described in the

Submission Descriptions at any time, including, but not limited to, in the submission process and

after approval of the Submission Description by Apple. If You would like to provide additional content, functionality or services through the In-App Purchase API that are not described in Your

Submission Description, then You must first submit a new or updated Submission Description for

review and approval by Apple prior to making such items available through the use of the In-App

Purchase API. Apple reserves the right to withdraw its approval of content, functionality, or

services previously approved, and You agree to stop making any such content, functionality, or

services available for use within Your Application.

1.3

All content, functionality, and services offered through the ln-App Purchase API are

subject to the Program Requirements for Applications, and after such content, services or

functionality are added to a Licensed Application, they will be deemed part of the Licensed

Application and will be subject to all the same obligations and requirements.

2.

Additional Restrictions

2.1

You may not use the In-App Purchase API to enable an end-user to set up a pre-paid

account to be used for subsequent purchases of content, functionality, or services, or otherwise

create balances or credits that end-users can redeem or use to make purchases at a later time.

2.2

You may not enable end-users to purchase Currency of any kind through the In-App

Purchase API, including but not limited to any Currency for exchange, gifting, redemption,

transfer, trading or use in purchasing or obtaining anything within or outside of Your Application. "Currency" means any form of currency, points, credits, resources, content or other items or units

recognized by a group of individuals or entities as representing a particular value and that can be

transferred or circulated as a medium of exchange.

2.3

Content and services may be offered through the ln-App Purchase API on a

subscription basis (e.g., subscriptions to newspapers and magazines). Rentals of content,

services or functionality through the In-App Purchase API are not allowed (e.g., use of particular

content may not be restricted to a pre-determined, limited period of time).

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3.9 of the Agreement, if Your Licensed Application is content based (e.g., magazines and newspapers) and offered on an auto-renewing subscription basis through the use of the In-App Purchase API, You may collect certain user data (e.g., user

Program Agreement

Page 30

DX-4327. 030

APL-APPSTORE 10334844

name, email address, zip code), provided that You clearly and conspicuously notify the user of Your privacy policy and that its terms will govern the ways that You may use such information, and further provided that the user consents to Your collection and use prior to gathering such data. You agree to maintain, and strictly comply with the terms of, Your privacy policy.

2.4

You may not use the ln-App Purchase API to send any software updates to Your

Application or otherwise add any additional executable code to Your Application. An In-App Purchase item must either already exist in Your Application waiting to be unlocked, be streamed

to Your Application after the In-App Purchase API transaction has been completed, or be

downloaded to Your Application solely as data after such transaction has been completed.

2.5

You may not use the ln-App Purchase API to deliver any items that contain content

or materials of any kind (text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that in Apple's

reasonable judgment may be found objectionable or inappropriate, for example, materials that

may be considered obscene, pornographic, or defamatory.

2.6

With the exception of items of content that an end-user consumes or uses up within

Your Application (e.g., virtual supplies such as construction materials) (a "Consumable" ), any

other content, functionality, services or subscriptions delivered through the use of the ln-App

Purchase API (e.g., a sword for a game) (a "Non-Consumable" ) must be made available to end-

users in accordance with the same usage rules as Licensed Applications (e.g., any such content,

services or functionality must be available to all of the devices associated with an end-user's

account). You will be responsible for identifying Consumable items to Apple and for disclosing to

end-users that Consumables will not be available for use on other devices.

3.

Your Responsibilities

3.1

For each successfully completed transaction made using the ln-App Purchase API,

Apple will provide You with a transaction receipt. It is Your responsibility to verify the validity of

such receipt prior to the delivery of any content, functionality, or services to an end-user and

Apple will not be liable for Your failure to verify that any such transaction receipt came from

Apple.

3.2

Unless Apple provides You with user interface elements, You are responsible for

developing the user interface Your Application will display to end-users for orders made through

the ln-App Purchase API. You agree not to misrepresent, falsely claim, mislead or engage in any

unfair or deceptive acts or practices regarding the promotion and sale of items through Your use

of the ln-App Purchase API, including, but not limited to, in the Licensed Application Information

and any metadata that You submit through iTunes Connect. You agree to comply with all

applicable laws and regulations, including those in any jurisdictions in which you make content,

functionality, services or subscriptions available through the use of the In-App Purchase API,

including but not limited to consumer laws and export regulations.

3.3

Apple may provide hosting services for Non-Consumables that You would like to

provide to Your end-users through the use of the In-App Purchase API. Even if Apple hosts such Non-Consumables on Your behalf, You are responsible for providing items ordered through the

In-App Purchase API in a timely manner (i.e., promptly after Apple issues the transaction receipt,

except in cases where You have disclosed to Your end-user that the item will be made available

at a later time) and for complying with all applicable laws in connection therewith, including but

not limited to, laws, rules and regulations related to cancellation or delivery of ordered items. You

are responsible for maintaining Your own records for all such transactions.

3.4

You will not issue any refunds to end-users of Your Application, and You agree that

Apple may issue refunds to end-users in accordance with the terms of Schedule 2.
