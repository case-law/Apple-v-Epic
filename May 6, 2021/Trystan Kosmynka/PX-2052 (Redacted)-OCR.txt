Ricardo,

The XcodeGhost issue has generated much more interest in acquiring So u rceDNA.Now would be a opportunistic time to resume these conversations.

This technology & team would be a huge advantage for Columbus, malware detection, reactive product security and technical investigation tean within App Review.

In the case of Xcodeghost SourceDNA would have llagged this with their system for new library discovery which clusters unrecognized code across developers.

Where we left olf with corporate development was that we needed the Columbus headcount to get approved before we get the support to make a move.

Here is the summary

Business - Founder Nate Lawson is a world dass engineer, world dass security expert. - 5 engineers, all local - Recently raised 1.4M - Part of Y Combinator August I September - In discussions with another unnamed large tech company

Technical
- Patented binary analysistrcomparison
- Built their own decompiler to reverse binaries to a common IL more suitable for analysis - Built their own Android emulator (not something we need but shows the extent to which they' ve went to solve some problems) - static analysis plat(ann - custom built decompiler
