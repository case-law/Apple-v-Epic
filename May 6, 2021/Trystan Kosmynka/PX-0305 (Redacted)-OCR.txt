12/12/14: App was ERB-Rejected for streaming games. The app is streaming games which we don't like, since these games don't come into review. The app was rejected for PLA 3.3.2 which is the guideline we use for apps with this functionality. If they can resolve the issue by having these games embedded in the app, this would sagsfy the PLA 3.3.2 issue.
Dev's response (12/12/14): Since the app sheams about 5-6 million games/year from their doud servers, they don't believe it' ll be feasible to embed that many games into the app's binary. Would this solufiion make sense?
- Reducing the number of games available (select the top 10K, or 50K, etc.) and then "locking them in" so that no new games are streamed to the app between binaries. That way, App Review will always have access to any new games added, since nothing will be streamed in between epp reviews.
1/13I15: While the app was slated to go to the ERB, the note below signifies that there waseither no quorum or no actual meeting, and the process back then (for those instances where there wasn't a meeting) was that Phillip would circulate the deck vie email to the ERB members, and if no response from anyone, then he'd make the call.

Hi Trystan, Eran looked into this one and it appears that the app went to ERB for the potential "store within a store" issue. See ERB notesbelow. The epp also have the necessary UGC blocking mechanism.
Red text: PLA 3.3.2: Universal. Update (added social features). This social network has a catalog of free block-style games created by other users. Games are added/changed server side. Afi games ere free, but the epp has a marketplace with paid game assets like characters and weapons (uses Consumable IAP). Users can also host challenges with a premium account(Non-Renewing Subscription).
