Thanks Shaan.
Amazon is also complaining about this. We need to have one set of rules that all apps follow whether they are from Apple or third-party developers.
Thanks, Tom

Trystan,

Developers (latest Linkedln) cannot fathom why our apps are permitted to do things they are not ..

Just wanted to pass along the feedback.

Hey Tom, I' ve reviewed a number of trial flows over the last few days and no ced that Linkedln's design is very much in line with Apple's own flows/language. Can you please help me understand what Apple is doing differently from our flows? I can ask the team to move the fine print above the CTA as that is the major difference I see.I'd appreciate any guidance you have on the below.
