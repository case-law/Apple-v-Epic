Abuse detection and response

To gain visibility into the extent cf out-of-band payments, we would need to have stslf in-country playing games as normal customers do AND also spending fime on the street looking for promotions with QR codes (on the side Df buses isa real example) that lead to out-of-band purchases. The goal of this acfivity is twofold:

1) identify obvious abuses and refer to AppReview for action 2) develop game-specilic player profiles by dividing players into cohorts -- payer and non-payer [perhaps at different
attern. spend levels]. The purpose is to establish "ground truth" about each usage p Once we know what a payer looks like, we can study the data available to Apple and correlate time-in-app with purchase activity. If our profile for game X indicates that six hours of game play requires regular payment AND we see a large population of users who are not also payers, we can conclude that purchases are happening out of band.
Action: establish in-country team for this funcfion.

N.B. beyond finding obvious abuses there is no clearly defined response. If w e had e rfect detection wh atwould we do with that infonnsfion?
"Hole"

Wechat and Facebook have both tried to create dedicated pipes for out-of-band payments to unlock app features (e.g. subscriptions). This breaks our rules.

What is NOT a violation is the following: 1. Developer pops e dialogue inviting users to 'follow us on [social plafform] to leam about new features
anrt-lworaegena-[Promofions would be a violation; an invitafion lo follow by itself is not] 2. On social media, without using dedicated pipes from the social media platform, the developer promotes discounted
content and accepts payment by Wechat or PayPsl, etc.

Actions: Apple creates a better experience for developers to engage users and offer promofions. It would have to be a LOT
better to overcome the 30% hit however. It would also have to meet the need fulfified by social media platforms for engagement, namely viral reach across friends. This is not something we' ve ever succeeded with and we would not be cross-platform. [included for completeness, not recommended]

Guidelines "hole"
WeChat and Facebook have both tried to create dedicated pipes for out-of-band payments to unlock app features (e.g. subscriptions).
This breaks our rules
What is NOT a violation is the following: 1. Developer pops a dialogue inviting users to "follow us on [social plafform] to
leam about new features and promotions
If we saw "promotions" in the dialog we'd look at it further because there could be a violation there. Features and functionality must only be unlocked via IAP, so if they were to enable unlocking via some promotion on social or elsewhere that could be in issue. Perhaps we just call this section a "Hole" rather than a guideline hole. It's possible a developer can market things outside their app that we do not have visibility to, period.
3.1.1 In-App Purchase: · If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example:
subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable

2. On social media, without using dedicated pipes from the social media platform, the developer promotes discounted content and accepts payment by WeChat or PayPal, etc.
