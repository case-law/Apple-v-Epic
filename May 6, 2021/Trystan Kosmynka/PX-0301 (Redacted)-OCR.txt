Hello Cathy,

Thanks for reaching out.

This is an ERB ruling and the app will be hidden for being a store within our store. Raphael made the cell this afternoon which is why they are now escalafing in an attempt to make their case. The concept for this app is not OK under 3.2.2, they are a live multiplayer games platform which we do not allow. Unfortunately, the app has been live since 2015 so this is shoddng for them, just as it was for Games who recently UTBed them.

ERB ruling: h s J/elevate.a le.com/tickets/1997148

They can formally appeal to the ARB but I'm congdent the rejecgon will be upheld since it comes from ERB. We have no additional information to share with them other than what was provided on the call and send via RC, it's a concept rejecbon. I'm confident they understand that there is no way to modil'y the app or adapt their platform to resolve this concept issue.

Best regards,

Bill

Dear Catherine,

I'm Cyril, founder of Tribe. We' re a SF based gaming app backed by Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins.

We' ve just received a call fiom the Appstore saying that our App (TRIBE) was about the get hidden-deleted fiom the store in the next 24hours.

Exhibit PX 301
PX-0301.1 APL-APPSTORE 03057326

The explanation was pretty vague but fiom what we' ve understood, it was something along those lignes:

"Apple just changed its guidelines about applications that have onboarded mini games inside. The app will be remove of the store tmw and we have to change our "concept".

There is many big apps (WeChat, Messenger, Roblox) in the same usecase. (small inside game store + many games) Are we all getting banned in the same time? Is there a way to have more color and details about whats "wrong" so we can understand and adapt?

Here is our app: h s : / /itunes.a I e.com/5/a / t r ibe- ames/id1053998412=?eI ndgmt=g

Here is a short demo of it: h s: / /www.ins
