I need you to take leadership regarding what's going on with all forms of fraud on the App Store and have someone on your team focus on this. Like many other initiatives, there are lots of, people working on f'raud across ISB S and Apple, but no one lls leading the effort frofn 8 product perspecbve and provldlng a vlslon for what we need 'to do to properly address It.

Hey Pedraum,
Matt and I caught up this afternoon over the phone and we were talking about App Store Fraud/Risk. There's a lot of Ingleh'ves going on In the organizaiton and we bothfeelthatthehmmg Is nght to start to establish a productArlven program around Fraud/Risk (maybe even call it Trust and Safety). When you' re back next week I'd like to set up some time with you to discuss, I' ve spent the last month going pretty deep to understand the landscape and there's material business justification for the amount af fraud that's occurring on our storefronts, especially In China. So we believe Ilhere is a big impact for both developers and customers. I' ll have Faye setup ameeting for middle of next week.
Thanksl REcafdo'
