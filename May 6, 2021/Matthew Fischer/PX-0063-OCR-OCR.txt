Hi Paolo,
For a while now we see apps that only speak Chinese in the top 10 of the German grossing lists. Today there are two different ones for iPhone and iPad at the first position:
h: / / i tunes.a le.com/de/a /kuai-le- i- ai/id459397568?mt = 8&ls = l
h: / / i tunes.a le.com/de/a /zu- iu-tian-xia2/id472215383?mt = 8&ls =l
We are prettysure thatthe in-app purchases ofthese apps are bought with hacked German accounts as has happened before with titles like Sega's Kingdoms at War and others. (A sure sign is that the most expensive item is the most &equently bought one) This time the hackers seem to have changed the hacked account's passwords, so that the victims can neither cry out in the apps review nor demand the money back (I can't be sure of the latter as I just don't see -anyone star reviews crying for help as was the case for the last hacks)
- It hurts Apples reputation in Germany a lot, as it makes the App Store seem to be a home of hackers. - It hurts the app developers that are accused of doing the &aud, because the users do not know that Apple controls the accounting. - It hurts my company because our app has for months been constantly fighting to stay in the top 10 against those &audulent app's positions.
Accounts with credit cards are asked for the three number code on the back when you buy with a new device. However, accounts using Click And Buy or that are filled up by vouchers or gift coupons are not getting any security question and are therefore an easy target.
Could Cupertino be convinced to install a security question for accounts that use payment systems that have no security tokens of their own?
Have nice weekend,
