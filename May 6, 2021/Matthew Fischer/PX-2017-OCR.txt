The report is amazing, very informative Note you have a scam app, NPam Reading Booth", on the top charts that should not be on the

We' ve updated the weekly App Store and Mac App Store dashboard to be more informative and visually appealing. In addition to the data shared in the past version, we' ve included forecasts on units, billings and customers, through the end of the year. For those interested, at the bottom, we' ve also included the top fin, top paid and top grossing apps fiom the past week, along with their ranks and w/w movement.

Please mke a look and let me know what you think.
