Hi Phil. Thank you for your time. I'm here to share highlights of the US App Store Developer Survey, the results of which Art shared with you a few weeks ago.
We also had emailed our takeaways and actions from the survey. You had provided feedback that some of the actions
were good and some were very bad. So, with this, I'rn not going to present the entire survey, since you' ve already seen it.
Rather, I will discuss sections for tied to the recommendations we emailed, as we'd love to hear your perspective on what
actions you think are viable, so we can proceed accordingly.

70%, 37%,33%, 26%
We believe that this perception will be positively impacted with the rollout of Subscriptions 2.0 and Search Ads this fall.
We know that Kenobi will help with this, as well as developer responses to reviews.
Beyond this, we are looking at additional ways to help developers in these areas.

We asked developers what their top levers were for driving downloads. App Store featuring is over-emphasized by developers as a user acquisition iever. We' ve published developer guidance since this survey that has emphasized the importance of App Store search to driving downloads. In addition to articles we' ve published on how to get discovered on App Store search, we will also help educate developers on effective user
acquisition marketing best practices, such as a case study on a small dev that effectively executed launch marketing.

This table shows the top reasons why developers aren't adopting App Previews. We know that adoption of App Previews is low, despite that they have the potential to increase conversion to download by over 30% when viewed. App Previews are an effective tool to help increase downloads. We will secure updated data on the positive impact of App Previews to communicate to developers.
We saw throughout the survey that, as with App Previews, the biggest reason for developers not adopting new features or platforms was resource constraints or lack of understanding of how it could impact their business. A key takeaway for us is to demonstrate the business value of feature or platform adoption with developers.

The survey also showed us that over half of paid developers don't leverage sales or price promotions for their paid apps.
Strategic and well-timed price promotions are key levers for driving paid app growth. There is an opportunity to educate
developers on this.

A key reason that the Download on the App Store badge is not used is that developers aren't convinced it provides an essential message in their creative. As the badges are redesigned by Marcom this year, the new badge needs to be created to help increase engagement with developers' creative in order to be adopted.

Developers believe that Apple product images help improve their creative effectiveness. However, a fifth of large
developers don't use the product images due to restrictive brand guidelines. We' ll share this feedback with Marcom to align on whether some guidelines should be adjusted in order to increase image use by developers.
