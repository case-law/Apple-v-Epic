Understood. We would not make any promises until we see the final product.

We will move forward with the technical discussions.

I am in agreement with briefin~. I am not in agreement with suggesting special pmmotion or treatment in the store.

Whetherwe do any future promotion and placement on the storedepends on how theapps come out, when they come out, what we want to do in the store at that time, etc.

We are not "bargaining" store placement for work. We never used to have to do that, the idea of seeing features early, getting to work with our engineers, to provide feedback to new APIs, and the possibility of placement in marketing, keynotes etc. was more than enough to interest developers in working with us.

Phil, Our idea around cross-promotion would be modeled on our efforts with the Minecrafi team. For example, placement in "What We 're Playing" on iOS App Store coinciding with the launch on tvOS App Store.
It would be positioned as working with the developer across the ecosystem with details to be worked out later.
If you' re in agreement, we 'd like to begin scheduling briefings as soon as possible. For developers traveling internationally we propose conducting briefings during GDC (March 1-3.) We have spoken to Apple Retail and they have a private and secure meeting space at Union

I am okay about disclosures (for both groups) and I cornered about what may be said regarding cross-promotion.

Phil,

We' ve arrived at a set of developers we 'd like to target for early J105 / B439 disclosure. We 've separated them into two groups:

-- J105 / B439 Disclosure Only -- J105 / B439 Disclosure + Cross Promotion

The Disclosure Only group (which includes the two primary game engine developers) already plan to support Apple TV. Early disclosure will ensure they are able to take advantage of new performance ofJ105 and B439 supportforlaunch atyearend.

For the second group, we propose a more detailed discussion similar to our approach with Minecraft which would include cross-promotion with an iOS version of the title. They either do not currently plan to support Apple TV or have no iOS plans as yet.

The briefings would be face-to-face and under NDA. Given most of these developers are firming their Holiday 2017 plans, we 'd like to start these briefings immediately.

Seeking your approval.

<PastedGraphic-5.png>
Pyre Supergiant Games B439 N/A -- Game Controller Required
The third and, arguably, most beautiful title from Indie darling, Supergiant Games. The game marks the first time Supergiant will build a local multiplayer game and this game has generated the most early buzz of any Supergiant title to date. Slated to launch this Summer on PS4, this game could be a great "statement" title for our platform.

projects in the works. We 'd need Unity onboard to not only adopt any new technology, but also to help developers work through compatibility issues, so they 're ready Day One.
<Unity.jpg>
Unreal Engine Epic Games
Trusted developer of very robust engine underpinning lots of popular iOS games. Long lead will help us target those titles. Additionally, they 'd need to help Cornfox & Bros. and 505 Games to bring Oceanhorn 2 and Abzu to the platform, respectively.

J105 / B439 Disclosure + Cross-Promotion
Final Fantasy XV Square Enix B439 N/A -- Game Controller Required
Final Fantasy XV is a deep and expansive role-playing game. It was one of the biggest launches on console this past holiday and Square Enix is working hard to recreate the same feel in their mobile version.
<PastedGraphic-7.png>
Asphalt 9 Gameloft
One of the most successful arcade racing franchises ever. Gameloft has spent the last few years, and tremendous resources, building the "future of the Asphalt franchise." This game is the first game we 've seen that was built from the ground up to take advantage of Metal (and not retrofitted.) This has the potential to become the gold standard for high-fidelity games on our platform. Tech demo looked absolutely stunning.

NBA 2K18 2K Sports B439 N/A -- Game Controller Required
One of the largest sports game franchises. 2K 's bread and butter has been console, but are increasingly including mobile in their strategy, with the NBA 2K games. They were bullish on Apple TV but, after launching NBA 2K16 on the platform with extremely disappointing numbers, they decided to focus only on iOS. Getting them back onto the Apple TV platform would be a huge win for our story in the living room.

F1 2017 Exient / Codemasters
F1 immerses you in not only the on-track excitement of a Formula One career, including the inclusion of the iconic Safety Car and also the Virtual Safety Car for the first time, but also uniquely offers the drama and vehicle development that goes on behind the scenes. The title is stunning on PC / Console, and although they did ship on Apple TV, Codemasters hit the limits of our hardware, and had to walk back some of the higher-fidelity elements of the game. Early disclosure would give them the ramp they need to take things to the next level.
