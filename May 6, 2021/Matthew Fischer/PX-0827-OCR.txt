In light of what happened with SkyDrive this week, I'd like to be proactive in getting these developers in line. It's not fair that SkyDrive could be approved without IAP and then add purchasable items to their website the day after their app is reviewed. If the developers currently on the store never submit updates, they will never be in compliance.
Thanks for revisiting this with the ERB again this week.

The guidance Irom the ERB is to catch them when they resubmit, nothing more. I can discuss this with them on Friday, but we just had this discussion last Friday. Regarding DropBox, there is no issue there, they do support IAP.

Thanks for the additional detail Phillip. We can address this with Microsofi and ask them to submit a new build with IAP for the upgrade items. Can we give all of these developers who are out of compliance a deadline (perhaps May 15?) by which they need to resubmit a build with
IAP to be fair to everyone in this category?

It appears that a SkyDrive update was just approved (went live on the store 4/23/12) which should also be included in this category of apps that requhz IAP for the purchase of additional storage. They currently offer no IAP, yet SkyDrive storage plan subscriptions are sold through the SkyDrive website. This needs to be fixed. This is not consistent with what we are telling Google about Google
Drive.

Thanks for the heads up.
So, just to be clear, what will the policy be moving forward for these types of cloud storage offerings?

Yes, this is correct. Regarding dropbox, there is no guideline that says they must implement all upgrade options also available on their website. Regardingbox.net, once they resubmit, they will be handled accordingly, per Eddy.

Heads up that we have rejected the Google Drive app (cloud storage) &om the App Store for not offering the purchase of additional storage space through the app as they do through the Google website. The app needs to be using IAP for a service that is allowing users to "upgrade" their storage size. We notified Google of this four weeks ago when the app was originally reviewed. Google appealed the ruling, but their appeal was rejected.
Google plans to launch the new product on the web and for Android mobile devices on Tuesday, April 24.
App Review is currently looking into the treatment of Dropbox andBox.net as other apps in this category which have not fully implemented IAP (Dropbox only offers one of several upgrade options through IAP, andBox.net does not offer any upgrade options through IAP).
Just want to make sure you are all in the loop about why this app will not be launching on the App Store when it goes live next week based on Google's current plans.
