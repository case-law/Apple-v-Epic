Thanks Matt-

Just want to set expectations correctly here. We have a mass-request tool that will allow us to send the emails, however we are still testing to make sure that we can accurately include the names of the apps for each customer. There have been issues with this speci5c functionality in the past.
Also - I want to be clear that the tool is very limited in the number of emails it can handle. With a batch this big (128M) we would likely have to spend up to a week sending these messages, so after localizing the emails (which will take several days) we 'll need at least a week for the sendif we are using the mass-request tool.
I' ll let you know the results of our testing of the functionality as soon as they 're complete.

Adding Joz, per Phil and Ron's request. I' ve also added Emily, as well as Matt, Glenn and Dale from iTunes Operations.

On the customer front, Ayman has concluded his analysis, and in total, 128M customers have downloaded the2500+ apps thatwere affected LTD. Those customers drove 203M downloads of
the 2500+ affected apps LTD. More details below.

Joz, Tom and Christine - due to the large number of customers potentially affected, do we want to send an email to all of them?

If yes, Dale Bagwell from our Customer Experience team will be on point to manage this on our side. Note that this will pose some challenges in terms of language localizations of the email, since the
downloads of these apps took place in a wide variety of App Store storefronts around the world (e.g. we wouldn't want to send an English-language email to a customer who downloaded one or more of these apps from the Brazil App Store, where Brazilian Portuguese would be the more appropriate language).

Best,

Matt

Ayman,

Per our conversation, please run a report on LTD downloads of the following apps.

Then we need to know the total number of customers that have downloaded these apps to determine the potential totalnumber ofcustomers affected.

Thanks,
