Thanks. Unfortunately, IAP being "optional"means that no one will ever use it.

As we discussed, we want you to come up with the next approach that will work for us and our developers.

> Trystan congrmed that IAP was optional for the membership subscriptions, so I communicated this message to Lyft today. Lyft launched the $300/month "all access' model without IAP, and is currently tesging the $5-10/month subscription. No action required on your end but wanted to 1st you know in case Logan reached out. I plan to speak with Uber next week.

p Let me know ifyou have any questions.
