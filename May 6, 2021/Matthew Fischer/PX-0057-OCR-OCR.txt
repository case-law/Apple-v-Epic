I understand his concern as to the cost issue here, but I have to say that there's not much we can do here. We don't adjust our guidelines in orderto make It easierfor sonle developers to make money And while we have some outliers in the store right new, I cannot guarantee that we will amow them to continue.
We are still making decisions on Ois front, but I do believethat we vol continue to disallow this made).

Hi Phillip

Oe Developer of "Jammit" reachedout to me Iecently Iegarding an App rejection he received a few months ago. It seems the issue w'as he was not using In App purchase, instead having people buy additional "Songs" from the website (within a webklt view in the Appj.

The issue for him is Oe 36'L cut using our In App purchase, which would nlean he is losing money on every transaction since he is already paying arbst and songwnters fees before that even happens. If he was to remove all references of
buying additional content oubliide of OI8 App, and instead jUst focused Oe music fullctlon while massaging (only outside of the app and without any linksfrom the app) that addiTionaI content is available on his website would that meet our
guidelinesV It appears that iswhat MLB.comdid, so I wanted to askto see if it would also apply here.

Any guidance 5 feedback would be greatly appreciated, it is8 cool App for musicians and I think 8 great potential title for iGS.
