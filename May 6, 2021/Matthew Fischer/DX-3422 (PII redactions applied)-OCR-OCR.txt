As some of you leow, s few of us had a conversation almost exactly s year ago that we needed Io really step up and deliver a great set of new App Store features at NfWDC 2014 -- features that would help our custoniers discover apps more easily, as well ss new tools to help our developers build great apps and iriansge theirbusinesses on iOS more effectively. I'min~ ly proud ol the neer features we unveiled last week, including:
-- Explore -- Trending siarches -- Related searches
-- Editorial badging
-- App bundles -- App prevlews -- All =new iTunes Connect -- TastRight -- App analytics -- afld mor' e,.
I' ve been et Apple for 11 years, and it was by far the most excited I' ve seen our developers about Apple and where we are going as a company
I wanted to express my gratitude to everyone on the tearri for your continued herd work, focus and dedicatton to ensure a successt'ui launch of all of Ihei e new features later this year.
