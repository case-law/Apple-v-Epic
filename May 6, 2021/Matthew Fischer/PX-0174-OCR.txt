Tim received a complaint about this app being a scain (doesn't do what it says, proinises bonus features for 5 star reviews, creates fake marketing videos, etc). It is a great example of the stuff we should have automatic tools to find and kick out of the store. I can't believe we still don' t. Many I star reviews, many mention "scam" and "fake". Then I look at the developers other apps sndseethe sameissuerepeated.
Please look into this. I expect we need to reinove the developer from our program. (and PLEASE develop a system to automatically find low rated eppe end purge them!!)

Subject: Fraudulent App on App Store

Hello Mr. Cook, Recently I' ve noticed fake accounts on social media spamming posts advertising for an
app on the App Store called "Themes Guru - Custom LockScreen Themes 8r. Wallpapers". They state that this app will grant you the ability to have features such as dynamic spp icons and dynamic lock screens (separate from the iOS 7+ bubbles backgrounds). The screenshots on its App Store page also show features such as a redesigned media playback contml at lock screen and different "slide to unlock" bars. Alter purchasing and installing the application the user discovers these features arc not present, and is instructed to give thc app a 5-star review in order to "unlock" them. This of course does not unlock them, however it raises the application's
overall rating causing more people to fall victim to this scam.Please alert the App Store review team of this issue as soon as possible.
Thanks for yo
Conlidenael
