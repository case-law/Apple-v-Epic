Below is the version Phil has just given his green signal. If you agree, we could delete the first sentence in the fiith paragraph.

We still need to fifi in the missing data (highlighted in red below) to the best we could. Best, Jun

1. Apple's management has attached great importance to XcodeGhost issue. - Intemafiy, we have marshalled a lot of resources across afi Apple to analyse the situafion, check every app on the app
store, remove infected apps from App Store, contact the relevant impacted developers, assist developers with checking their software and getting dean apps back on the store quickly, block any new submissions of apps with the infection. - On Sept. 22, Phil Schifier, Apple's Senior Vice President in charge of Product Markefing, accepted Sina Technology's
interview on XcodeGhost issue and answered key questions about it. Apple always recommends developers use the free, secure tools Apple provides them -- induding Xcode -- to ensure they' re creafing the most secure apps for App Store
customers. Apple incorporates technologies like Gatekeeper expressly to prevent non-App Store and/or unsigned versions of programs, induding Xcode, from being installed. Those protections had to have been deliberately disabled by the developer for something like XcodeGhost to successfully install. Sometimes developers search for our tools, such as Xcode, on other, non-Apple sites in an effort to find faster downloads of developer tools. Apple is working to make it faster for developers in Chinato download Xcode bates.

2. Apple has published a XcodeGhost Q&A at its ofiicial website, explaining about the background of the issue, why it happened, how the consumers could diagnose if their devices have been infected and what they should do, and Apple's measures against the infected apps. Here is the link h y / w ww.a l e .com/cn/xcode host./

3. Apple has published a list of the top 25 most popular apps impacted at its otfidal website. Afier the top 25 impacted apps, the number of impacted users drops significantly. If users have one of these apps, they should update the affected app which will fix the issue on the user's device. If the app is available on App Store, it has been updated, if it isn't available it should be updated very soon. Here is the link h / /w ww a l e com/cn/xcode host/

4. ARer XcodeGhost issue happened, Apple did a screening of afithe apps in App Store and took olf afi the infected apps.

We found that 4,743 apps were infected and about

users were affected (actual number may be less

because users may not have kept those epps on their devices). Of the 4,743 apps, 1,342 apps don't have a dean version on

App Store yet, with 23.7M [to further verify] customers. We also blocked apps which were infected from being submitted.

5. Apple is working on further measures that recommend to the users to update their infected apps with clean versions and delete those without clean versions. The best way to resolve this situation is for users to automatically update their compromised apps with new apps posted by the developer. This removes the malware from users devices. That is why our focus has been on taking down compromise apps and getting developers to put back up non-compromised versions to update users' devices.

6. We believe that the malware cannot access much user data due to our system sandboxing and other built in

countermeasures, and this malware has not been used to actually gather user data at this time.

while this statement is true, we have several options, and I think it is important to get PR, GA on the same page and then we can go backtothe executives with afurtherrecommendation.

Yes Bella,

That is correct. For the 4,743, we can provide the number of customers, but be aware that this includes very popular apps that were quickly resolved, so the number will be very large.

Ayman - doyou have the number pulledalready?

Regardingthe 1,342 apps, they do have been removed from App Store.Those apps have 23.7M customers.Is my understanding correct?

Can we at least provide the consumers of 4,743 apps before the deadline? MIIT experts believe this figure should be available.

A few updates to consider

The total infected should be 4,743 as some of the 4,955 were never put on the store (just testing phase of apps).

There are 1,342 apps that were actually downloaded that have not been updated (vs. the 1,905 mentioned below). We are down to 23.7 million customers impacted (not the 30.6 million), since the three biggest apps have all been updated.

Those blanks are going to be difficult to fill in, as it requires a lot of information, including apps being deleted from devices, etc.

Thanks

Hi all,

I have updated Point 4 8 5 of the response to MIIT with new input received.

4. After XcodeGhost issue happened, Apple did a screening of all the apps in App Store, and we found that 4,955 apps

were infected and about

users were affected. Of the 4,944 apps, 1,905 apps don't have a clean version

on App Store yet, with 30.6M customers, among which 74% (22.6M) is in China. Aft e r the measures Apple has taken,

many of the affected users have updated their infected apps and by Sept.

, there are about

users

who still have not done the update of the infected apps they have downloaded to their devices.

Ayman, please help with figures for the blankets as early as possible. We need to get Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue's approval

for the document by COB of Sept. 29 (Cupertino time)

5. Apple is working on further measures that recommend to the users to update their infected apps with clean versions and delete those without clean versions. Carolyn, I have made this sentence based on the information you shared. Please confirm if it 's ok with PR.

Attached is the updated full version. GA has started the translation. (answers toMIIT on XcodeGhost 092015 ENv2.pages)

Hi Ayman,

Many thanks for providing the figures at such short notice. Two questions: 1. Regarding the 1,905 apps with no clean version, are they already downloaded from App Store? 2. Of the 4,955 - 1,905 = 3,050 apps with clear versions, do you have figures how many (or %) of the users have

Here are some details we are able to share right now.

App Review has provided us with a list of infected apps. This list represents versions scanned in the date range 1/1/2015 - 9/24/2015.
· The list is 4,955 infected apps · 1,905 of these apps don't have a clean version on the store
Given these 1.9K apps, we are looking at 30.6M customers. The two main countries impacted:
· China 22.6M (74%) · USA 2 7M (9%)

We are currently running queries to understand how many total customers installed the 4,955 infected apps. Our estimate is to have this by EOD tomorrow.

Hi Ben,

Could you help with the numbers of users affected by the infected apps? How many were there when XcodeGhost wasfound,and how many by now since some users should have updated the apps? MIIT wants to see the trend, expecting a decline of the affected users.

Hi all,

Here is a draft response GA has composed. It has 5 points. - The first 3 points are quotes from the QBA and Phil's interview, covering the measures Apple has taken. - In point 4, I have set blank areas for figures MIIT expects us to provide. Craig and Andrew, please adjust this point as you see proper, based on the figures you get. Could you get the figures by tomorrow? - in point 5, in response to MIIT request for suggestion on how to inform users that have been infected but still have not made updates, GA proposes "Apple will work with some popular portals to call users to do app updates", for the team to discuss. Please suggest if you have better ideas.

The deadline for us is Sept. 30. We also need some time to get the needed approvals and finalise the Chinese version. Your quick comment and response are highly appreciated. (answers toMIIT on XcodeGhost 092015 ENv1.pages)

Hi Craig and Andrew,

At the meeting last Friday, in order to have a clear picture of the impact of XcodeGhost, MIIT required Apple to provide a written material before National Holiday (Oct. 1) about measures we
have takenand also such figures as: a. how many appshave been infected b. how many users have been affected, increase/decrease from beginning to present c. how many users are still using infected apps

We are also expected to suggest how to inform users that have been infected but still have not made updates. MIIT has considered making an announcement by itself, but is concerned about the potential publicity, and this is also not what we want to see.

Fro the written material, regarding what we have done, messages in the Qari and Phil's interview could begood enough. Regarding the figures and suggestion, couldyou help? We need togo back to MIIT by the noon of Sept. 30 the latest, as people will start holiday soon.

Hi all,

Here is a summary of the meeting this afternoon at MIIT.

MIIT Host: Deputy Director General LI Xuelin, Nebvork Security Administration Director FU Jinguang Nebvork Security Administration

Attendin or anizations: China Mobile, China Unicorn, China Telecom, CNCERT (National Computer Nehvork Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China), Tencent, Qihu 360, Antian Technologies and Appl e (GA and DR)

MIIT clarified that the purpose of the meeting was to understand XcodeGhost's impact and reasons (initiators), efforts against it, further measures needed for both government and the companies, and how to prevent such issue from happening again. M II T appreciated the attending companies' efforts related to XcodeGhost in the past one or bvo weeks and communication with MIIT. Each company was asked to introduce about their related
work andviews about the XcodeGhost.

GA and DR talked about Apple's measures, sticking strictly to the QBA at our website and Phil's interview with Sina. The three Carriers, Tencent, WeChat, Qihu 360 have all screened their self-developedapps and made amendments.

CNCERT Qihu 360andAntian Technolo iessharedtheirresearchfindin sabout XcodeGhost issue: 1. Over 20million users have been infected 2. XcodeGhost initiator is based in Shandong China, but has rented 3 servers from Amazon's cloud service in the U.S, which are still active in getting consumer data 3.Though there is not yet information about the misuse of the collected consumer data, the data could be used to remote control the devices infected to open webpages, make phone calls and send messages. It could also be used to create pop-ups to seduce consumers to install certain programs. The impact is wide and long term. It is the first case in its type. 4. About 4000 apps of different versions have been infected.

PX-21 73.6 APL-APPSTORE 08955666

CONFIDENTIAL

MIIT's re uirement for all attendin or anisations for next ste s: 1. The three carriers to take measures to block the connection between XcodeGhost initiator's serverand the consumers. To engage Amazon ifnecessary. 2. CNCERT, Antian Technologies and Qihu 360 to make further analysis about the harm of misuse of the collected consumer data, and validate the potential misuses. 3. MIIT will involve the police to identify the initiator(s). 4. CNCERT continue to monitor infected consumer data, to be compared with Apple's data 4. To support MIIT to understand the overall impact of XcodeGhost, Apple should provide a written material before National Holiday (Oct. 1) about measures taken and such figures as: a. how many apps have beeninfected b. how many users have been affected, increase/decrease from beginning to present c. how many users are still using infected apps;
O ther uestion to A l e : 1. XcodeGhost appeared in April, why Apple did not notice it?
2. suggestion of how to inform users that have been infected but still have not made updates (
MIIT has considered making an announcement by itself, but is concerned about the potential publicity).
MIIT summarised that XcodeGhost issue happened because of problems at different sections of a whole chain, including Apple's verification mechanism. What all the parties should do now is to join efforts to solve the issue in a sound way.
Please comment if and how we could provide a written material as MIIT required, and involve teams as needed.
Many thanks.

Carolyn and YeeWee, could you speak with Andrew and see how to resolve this PR presence issue?

Bella, any media will be there? Are they going to report the discussion? I assume it is a discussion without media coverage.

We need to do the right thing here. I worry that if we don't have the right people there, this meeting will be another trigger for bad publicity.

Hi Carolyn and Connie,
As just talked on the phone, CNCERT ( National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China) has contacted GA regarding Apps with malicious code in App store. CNCERT has released an alert regarding non-official XCODE of Apple has malicious code. CNCERT claims that according to its statistics, over thousands of consumers have been infected with the malicious code for downloading apps from App Store, and the consumer information leaked as a result should be dozens of million pieces, and the private information security of the Chinese consumers have been threatened seriously.
CNCERT claims that the issue has serious impact and may face some legal challenges.CNCERT asks Apple to provide a written explanation on the following questions:
1. Why App Store, as the source spreading the malicious code, did not detect Apps with the malicious code? What is the App security auditing mechanism in Apple? 2. In reaction to the alert by CNCERT,what measures have Apple taken to get rid of the security threats? 3. What measures will Apple take to deal with malicious codes that may appear in App Store in the future?
CNCERT emphasized that Apple should give importance to the impacts of the issue. Though self claiming a non-governmental non-profit cybersecurity technical centre, CNCERT is under the guidance of MIIT (the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) and plays important role in coordinating China's cybersecurity emergency response community.
I would like to know if the input you' ve got from Cupertino could answer the 3 questions? If not, could you help to involve relevant teams for the answers?
Thanks.
