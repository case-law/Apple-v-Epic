Makes sense, Todd.
Debankur - I wasn't aw'are that we were boosting the Files app and would like to know' how' that happened and who requested it In the future, I want any similar requests to come to me for review/approval

I don't think there's much to work with John on - I think Tim is just complaining that we have an ad there. When I just searchedfor 'fortnite", Puba was presented as an ad which istheir main competitor and it performs very weU.

manualy - I think the Files app was

boosted on the top forthe query "Dropbox" during iast ~C . W eare removing

the manual boost and the search results should be more relevant now (change will take effect in a couple of Ilours)

Also, Fyl, the quality of some of'the keywords in our 1st party appsare not very relevant and hencesearch results

are gettingimpacted. We are auditing those and viiU clean them up

- Grganic search results for the. query 'fortnite" seems to be worldng %ne. Please let us know If you see. any concerns there.

-- We are working with John Akred from IAd team to understand the ad relevancy concern with "fortnite" query. WUI keep youupdated about theIndings.

FYI - from Epic Games' CEO (developer of Fortnite, among other hit games). He's clearly not a fan of App Store search nor of Search Ads.
Also, who green lit putting the Files app above Dropbox in organic search results? I didn't know we did that, and I don't think we should.

Will get back to you on this one.

Best, Matt

From: Tim Sweeney Date:May 7,2018 at9:18:29 PM PDT To Subject: Rant: iOS App Store search is awful
As an iOS user, I just set up a new iPhone and installed the 12 apps I commonly use. None were the first search result when searching the App Store for the app's exact name. In fact, Dropbox wasn't even visible on the first page. Google bought the top search result, and Apple put its Files app ahead of Dropbox in line. For the search: "Dropbox".
As a developer, it's super-frustrating that Fortnite is not the first search result when customers search for the text: "Fortnite". Some days, Microsoft buys the search results, other days it's another competitor.
I can only imagine how an indie developer must feel when they' re trying to make a living and the $900B company that runs the App Store sells their search result to a $730B company.
This is an awful practice and should stop.
